Definition  of  “Money  Bills”.—(1)   For   the   purposes   of   this  Chapter, a Bill shall be deemed to be a Money Bill if it contains only provisions  dealing with all or any of the following matters, namely:—  (a) the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation of any tax;  (b) the regulation  of  the  borrowing  of  money  or  the  giving  of  any  guarantee by the State, or the amendment of the law with respect to any  financial obligations undertaken or to be undertaken by the State;  (c) the custody of the Consolidated Fund or the Contingency Fund  of  the  State,  the  payment  of  moneys  into  or  the  withdrawal  of  moneys  from any such Fund;  (d) the  appropriation  of  moneys  out  of  the  Consolidated  Fund  of  the State;  (e) the declaring  of  any  expenditure  to  be  expenditure  charged  on  the  Consolidated  Fund  of  the  State,  or  the  increasing  of  the  amount  of  any such expenditure;  (f) the receipt of money on account of the Consolidated Fund of the  State  or  the  public  account  of  the  State  or  the  custody  or  issue  of  such  money; or  (g) any   matter  incidental  to  any   of     the   matters  specified  in            sub-clauses  (a)  to (f).  (2) A Bill shall not be deemed to be a Money Bill by reason only that it  provides  for  the  imposition  of  fines  or  other  pecuniary  penalties,  or  for  the  demand  or  payment  of  fees  for  licences  or  fees  for  services  rendered,  or  by  reason  that  it  provides  for  the  imposition,  abolition,  remission,  alteration  or  regulation of any tax by any local authority or body for local purposes.  (3) If any question arises whether a Bill introduced in the Legislature of  a State which has a Legislative Council is a Money Bill or not, the decision of  the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of such State thereon shall be final.   122    (4)  There shall  be endorsed  on  every  Money  Bill  when it is  transmitted  to  the  Legislative  Council  under  article  198,  and  when  it  is  presented  to  the  Governor  for  assent  under  article  200,  the  certificate  of  the  Speaker  of  the  Legislative Assembly signed by him that it is a Money Bill.  200.  Assent  to  Bills.—When  a  Bill  has  been  passed  by  the  Legislative  Assembly of a State or, in the case of a State having a Legislative Council, has  been passed by both Houses of the Legislature of the State, it shall be presented  to the Governor and the Governor shall declare either that he assents to the Bill  or  that  he  withholds  assent  therefrom  or  that  he  reserves  the  Bill  for  the  consideration of the President:  Provided   that   the   Governor   may,   as   soon   as   possible   after   the  presentation to him of the Bill for assent, return the Bill if it is not a Money Bill  together  with  a  message  requesting  that  the  House  or  Houses  will  reconsider  the Bill or any specified provisions thereof and, in particular, will consider the  desirability  of  introducing  any  such  amendments  as  he  may  recommend  in  his  message and, when a Bill is so returned, the House or Houses shall reconsider  the  Bill  accordingly,  and  if  the  Bill  is  passed  again  by the  House  or  Houses  with  or  without  amendment  and  presented  to  the  Governor  for  assent,  the  Governor shall not withhold assent therefrom:  Provided  further  that  the  Governor  shall  not  assent  to,  but  shall  reserve  for  the  consideration  of  the  President,  any Bill  which  in  the  opinion  of  the  Governor  would,  if  it  became  law,  so  derogate  from  the  powers  of  the  High  Court  as  to  endanger  the  position  which  that  Court  is  by  this  Constitution  designed to fill.  201.  Bills  reserved  for  consideration.—When  a  Bill  is  reserved  by  a  Governor  for  the  consideration  of  the  President,  the  President  shall  declare  either that he assents to the Bill or that he withholds assent therefrom:  Provided  that,  where  the  Bill  is  not  a  Money  Bill,  the  President  may  direct the  Governor to return the  Bill  to the  House  or, as  the  case may  be, the  Houses  of  the  Legislature  of  the  State  together  with  such  a  message  as  is  mentioned in the first proviso to article 200 and, when a Bill is so returned, the  House  or  Houses  shall  reconsider  it  accordingly  within  a period  of  six  months  from the date of receipt of such message and, if it is again passed by the House  or  Houses  with  or  without  amendment,  it  shall  be  presented  again  to  the  President for his consideration.         123    Procedure in Financial Matters  202.

Procedure  in  Legislature  with  respect  to  estimates.—(1)  So  much of the estimates as relates to expenditure charged upon the Consolidated  Fund of a State shall not be submitted to the vote of the Legislative Assembly,  but nothing in this clause shall be construed as preventing the discussion in the  Legislature of any of those estimates.     124    (2) So much of the said estimates as relates to other expenditure shall be  submitted  in the  form  of  demands  for  grants to  the  Legislative  Assembly,  and  the Legislative Assembly shall have power to assent, or to refuse to  assent, to  any  demand,  or  to  assent  to  any  demand  subject  to  a  reduction  of  the  amount  specified therein.  (3) No demand for a grant shall be made except on the recommendation  of the Governor.  204.

(2)  No  amendment  shall  be  proposed  to  any  such  Bill  in  the  House  or  either  House  of  the  Legislature  of  the  State  which  will  have  the  effect  of  varying  the  amount  or  altering  the  destination  of  any  grant  so  made  or  of  varying  the  amount  of  any  expenditure  charged  on  the  Consolidated  Fund  of  the State, and the decision of the person presiding as to whether an amendment  is inadmissible under this clause shall be final.  (3) Subject to the provisions of articles 205 and 206, no money shall be  withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of the State except under appropriation  made by law passed in accordance with the provisions of this article.  205.  Supplementary,  additional  or  excess grants.—(1)  The  Governor  shall—  (a) if the amount authorised by any law made in accordance with the  provisions  of  article  204  to  be  expended  for  a  particular  service  for  the  current financial year is found to be insufficient for the purposes of that  year  or  when  a  need  has  arisen  during  the  current  financial  year  for  supplementary  or  additional  expenditure  upon  some  new  service  not  contemplated in the annual financial statement for that year, or  (b) if  any  money  has  been  spent  on  any  service  during  a  financial  year in excess of the amount granted for that service and for that year,   125    cause to be laid before the House or the Houses of the Legislature of the State  another statement showing the estimated amount of that expenditure or cause to  be presented to the Legislative Assembly of the State a demand for such excess,  as the case may be.  (2) The  provisions  of  articles  202,  203  and  204  shall  have  effect  in  relation to any  such statement  and expenditure  or  demand and also  to  any  law  to  be  made  authorising  the  appropriation  of  moneys  out  of  the  Consolidated  Fund  of  the  State  to  meet  such  expenditure  or  the  grant  in  respect  of  such  demand as they have effect in relation to the annual financial statement and the  expenditure  mentioned  therein  or  to  a  demand  for  a  grant  and  the  law  to  be  made for the authorisation of appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated  Fund of the State to meet such expenditure or grant.  206.  Votes  on  account,  votes  of  credit  and  exceptional  grants.—(1)  Notwithstanding  anything  in  the  foregoing  provisions  of  this  Chapter,  the  Legislative Assembly of a State shall have power—  (a) to   make   any   grant  in   advance   in  respect   of   the   estimated  expenditure  for  a  part  of  any  financial  year  pending  the  completion  of  the procedure  prescribed in article  203  for  the  voting  of  such  grant  and  the passing of the law in accordance with the provisions of article 204 in  relation to that expenditure;  (b) to  make  a  grant  for  meeting  an  unexpected  demand  upon  the  resources of the State when on account of the magnitude or the indefinite  character  of  the  service  the  demand  cannot  be  stated  with  the  details  ordinarily given in an annual financial statement;  (c) to  make  an  exceptional  grant  which  forms  no  part  of  the  current  service of any financial year;  and  the Legislature  of  the  State  shall  have  power  to  authorise  by  law  the  withdrawal of moneys from the Consolidated Fund of the State for the purposes  for which the said grants are made.  (2) The provisions of articles 203 and 204 shall have effect in relation to  the making of any grant under clause (1) and to any law to be made under that  clause as they have effect in relation to the making of a grant with regard to any  expenditure mentioned in the annual financial statement and the law to be made  for  the authorisation  of  appropriation  of  moneys  out  of  the  Consolidated  Fund  of the State to meet such expenditure.   126    207.

(3)  A  Bill  which,  if  enacted  and  brought  into  operation,  would  involve  expenditure  from  the  Consolidated  Fund  of  a  State  shall  not  be  passed  by  a  House of the Legislature of the State unless the Governor has recommended to  that House the consideration of the Bill.

Summons  how  served.—(1) Every  summons  shall  be  served  by  a  police  officer,  or  subject  to  such rules as the State Government may make in this behalf, by an officer of the Court issuing it or other  public servant.  (2) The summons shall, if practicable, be served personally on the person summoned, by delivering or  tendering to him one of the duplicates of the summons.   (3) Every person on whom a summons is so served shall, if so required by the serving officer, sign a  receipt therefor on the back of the other duplicate.  63.  Service  of  summons  on  corporate  bodies  and  societies.—Service  of  a  summons  on  a  corporation may be effected by serving it on the secretary, local manager or other principal officer of the  corporation, or by letter sent by registered post, addressed to the chief officer of the corporation in India,  in which case the service shall be deemed to have been effected when the letter would arrive in ordinary course  of post.  Explanation.—In  this  section,  “corporation”  means  an  incorporated  company  or  other  body  corporate  and  includes a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 (21 of 1860).                                                    1. Ins. by Act 5 of 2009, s.9 (w.e.f. 31-12-2009).   2. Ins. by s.10, ibid. (w.e.f. 31-12-2009).    41    64.  Service  when  persons  summoned  cannot  be  found.—Where  the  person  summoned  cannot,  by  the  exercise of due diligence, be  found, the summons may be served by leaving one of the duplicates for him with some  adult  male  member  of  his  family  residing  with  him,  and  the  person  with  whom  the  summons  is  so  left  shall,  if  so  required by the serving officer, sign a receipt therefor on the back of the other duplicate.  Explanation.—A servant is not a member of the family within the meaning of this section.  65. Procedure when service cannot be effected as before provided.—If service cannot by the exercise of due  diligence  be  effected  as  provided  in  section  62,  section  63  or  section  64,  the  serving  officer  shall  affix  one  of  the  duplicates  of  the  summons  to  some  conspicuous  part  of  the  house  or  homestead  in  which  the  person  summoned  ordinarily resides; and thereupon the  Court,  after  making such inquiries as it  thinks  fit,  may either declare  that  the  summons has been duly served or order fresh service in such manner as it considers proper.  66.  Service  on  Government  servant.—(1) Where  the  person  summoned  is  in  the  active  service  of  the  Government, the Court issuing the  summons shall ordinarily send it in duplicate to the  head of the office in which  such person is employed; and such head shall thereupon cause the summons to be served in the manner provided by  section 62, and shall return it to the Court under his signature with the endorsement required by that section.  (2) Such signature shall be evidence of due service.  67.  Service  of  summons  outside  local  limits.—When  a  Court  desires  that  a  summons  issued  by  it  shall  be  served at any place outside its local jurisdiction, it shall ordinarily send such summons in duplicate to a Magistrate  within whose local jurisdiction the person  summoned resides, or is, to be there served.   68. Proof of service in such cases and when serving officer not present.—(1) When a summons issued by a  Court  is  served  outside  its  local  jurisdiction,  and  in  any  case  where  the  officer  who  has  served  a  summons  is  not  present at  the hearing of the  case, an affidavit,  purporting  to be  made  before  a  Magistrate, that such summons has  been  served,  and  a  duplicate  of  the  summons  purporting  to  be  endorsed  (in  the  manner  provided  by  section  62  or  section  64)  by  the  person  to  whom  it  was  delivered  or  tendered  or  with  whom  it  was  left,  shall  be  admissible  in  evidence, and the statements made therein shall be deemed to be correct unless and until the contrary is proved.  (2) The affidavit mentioned in this section may be attached to the duplicate of the summons and returned to the  Court.  69.  Service  of  summons  on  witness  by  post.—(1) Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  the  preceding  sections  of  this  Chapter,  a  Court  issuing  a  summons  to  a  witness  may,  in  addition  to  and  simultaneously  with  the  issue of such summons, direct a copy of the summons to be served by registered post addressed to the witness at the  place where he ordinarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain.  (2) When an acknowledgement purporting to be signed by the witness or an endorsement purporting to be made  by a postal employee that the witness refused to take delivery of the summons has been received, the Court issuing  the summons may declare that the summons has been duly served.  B.—Warrant of arrest  70. Form of warrant of arrest and duration.—(1) Every warrant of arrest issued by a Court under this Code  shall be in writing, signed by the presiding officer of such Court and shall bear the seal of the Court.   (2) Every  such  warrant  shall  remain  in  force  until  it  is  cancelled  by  the  Court  which  issued  it,  or  until  it  is  executed.  71.  Power  to  direct  security  to  be  taken.—(1) Any  Court  issuing  a  warrant  for  the  arrest  of  any  person  may  in  its  discretion  direct  by  endorsement on  the  warrant  that,  if  such  person  executes  a  bond  with  sufficient  sureties  for  his  attendance  before  the  Court  at  a  specified  time  and  thereafter  until  otherwise  directed  by  the  Court,  the  officer  to  whom  the  warrant  is  directed  shall  take  such  security and  shall  release  such  person  from  custody.  (2) The endorsement shall state—  (a) the number of sureties;   42    (b) the  amount in  which they  and the  person  for  whose  arrest the  warrant is issued, are  to be  respectively  bound;  (c) the time at which he is to attend before the Court.  (3) Whenever security is taken under this section, the officer to whom the warrant is directed shall forward the  bond to the Court.  72. Warrants to whom directed.—(1) A warrant of arrest shall ordinarily be directed to one or more police  officers; but the Court issuing such a warrant may, if its immediate execution is necessary and no police officer is  immediately available, direct it to any other person or persons, and such person or persons shall execute the same.  (2) When a warrant is directed to more officers or persons than one, it may be executed by all, or by any one or  more of them.  73. Warrant  may be  directed to any person.—(1) The  Chief Judicial  Magistrate  or a  Magistrate  of  the  first  class  may  direct  a  warrant  to  any  person  within  his  local  jurisdiction  for  the  arrest  of  any  escaped  convict,  proclaimed offender or of any person who is accused of a non-bailable offence and is evading arrest.  (2) Such  person  shall  acknowledge  in  writing  the  receipt  of  the  warrant,  and  shall  execute it  if  the  person  for  whose arrest it was issued, is in, or enters on, any land or other property under his charge.  (3) When the person against whom such warrant is issued is arrested, he shall be made over with the warrant to  the nearest police officer, who shall cause him to be taken before a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case, unless  security is taken under section 71.  74. Warrant directed to police officer.—A warrant directed to any police officer may also be executed by any  other police officer whose name is endorsed upon the warrant by the officer to whom it is directed or endorsed.  75. Notification of substance of warrant.—The police officer or other person executing a warrant of arrest  shall notify the substance thereof to the person to be arrested, and, if so required, shall show him the warrant.  76. Person arrested to be brought before Court without delay.—The police officer or other person executing  a warrant of arrest shall (subject to the provisions of section 71 as to security) without unnecessary delay bring the  person arrested before the Court before which he is required by law to produce such person:  Provided that such delay shall not, in any case, exceed twenty-four hours exclusive of the time necessary for the  journey from the place of arrest to the Magistrate’s Court.  77. Where warrant may be executed.—A warrant of arrest may be executed at any place in India.  78. Warrant forwarded for execution outside jurisdiction.—(1) When a warrant is to be executed outside the  local jurisdiction of the Court issuing it, such Court may, instead of directing the  warrant to a police officer within  its jurisdiction, forward it by post or otherwise to any Executive Magistrate or District Superintendent of Police or  Commissioner  of  Police  within  the  local  limits  of  whose  jurisdiction  it  is  to  be  executed;  and  the  Executive  Magistrate or District Superintendent or Commissioner shall endorse his name thereon, and if practicable, cause it to  be executed in the manner hereinbefore provided.   (2) The  Court  issuing  a  warrant  under  sub-section (1) shall  forward,  along  with  the  warrant,  the  substance  of  the information against the person to be arrested together with such documents, if any, as may be sufficient to enable  the Court acting under section 81 to decide whether bail should or should not be granted to the person.  79. Warrant directed to police officer for execution outside jurisdiction.—(1) When a warrant directed to a  police officer is to be executed beyond the local jurisdiction of the Court issuing the same, he shall ordinarily take it  for endorsement either to an Executive Magistrate or to a police officer not below the rank of an officer in charge of  a police station, within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the warrant is to be executed.  (2) Such  Magistrate  or  police  officer  shall  endorse  his  name  thereon  and  such  endorsement  shall  be  sufficient  authority to the police officer to whom the  warrant is directed to execute the same, and the local police shall, if so  required, assist such officer in executing such warrant.   43     (3)  Whenever  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  the  delay  occasioned  by  obtaining  the  endorsement  of  the  Magistrate  or  police  officer  within  whose  local  jurisdiction  the  warrant  is  to  be  executed  will  prevent  such  execution,  the  police  officer  to  whom  it  is  directed  may  execute  the  same  without  such  endorsement  in  any  place  beyond the local jurisdiction of the Court which issued it.  80.  Procedure  on  arrest  of  person  against  whom  warrant  issued.—When  a  warrant  of  arrest  is  executed  outside  the  district  in  which  it  was  issued,  the  person  arrested  shall,  unless  the  Court  which  issued  the  warrant  is  within thirty  kilometres of the  place of arrest or is  nearer than  the  Executive  Magistrate  or District Superintendent   of    Police  or    Commissioner  of  Police  within  the  local  limits  of  whose  jurisdiction  the  arrest  was made,  or  unless  security is taken under section 71, be taken before such Magistrate or District Superintendent or Commissioner.  81. Procedure by Magistrate before whom such person arrested is brought.—(1) The Executive Magistrate  or District Superintendent of Police or Commissioner of Police shall, if the person arrested appears to be the person  intended by the Court which issued the warrant, direct his removal in custody to such Court:  Provided that, if the offence is bailable, and such person is ready and willing to give bail to the satisfaction of  such Magistrate, District Superintendent or Commissioner, or a direction has been endorsed under section 71 on the  warrant and such person is ready and willing to give the security required by such direction, the Magistrate, District  Superintendent or Commissioner shall take  such bail or security, as the  case  may be, and forward the  bond, to the  Court which issued the warrant:  Provided  further  that  if  the  offence  is  a  non-bailable  one,  it  shall  be  lawful  for  the  Chief  Judicial  Magistrate  (subject  to  the  provisions  of  section  437),  or  the  Sessions  Judge,  of  the  district  in  which  the  arrest  is  made  on  consideration  of  the  information  and  the documents  referred  to  in  sub-section (2) of  section  78,  to  release  such  person on bail.  (2) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent a police officer from taking security under section 71.  C.—Proclamation and attachment  82.  Proclamation  for  person  absconding.—(1) If  any  Court  has  reason  to  believe  (whether  after  taking  evidence  or  not)  that  any  person  against  whom  a  warrant  has  been  issued  by  it  has  absconded  or  is  concealing  himself  so  that  such  warrant  cannot  be  executed,  such  Court  may  publish a  written  proclamation  requiring  him  to  appear  at  a  specified  place  and  at  a  specified  time  not  less  than  thirty  days  from  the  date  of  publishing  such  proclamation.  (2) The proclamation shall be published as follows:—  (i) (a) it  shall  be  publicly  read  in  some  conspicuous  place  of  the  town  or  village  in  which  such  person  ordinarily resides;  (b) it shall be affixed to some conspicuous part of the house or homestead in which such person ordinarily  resides or to some conspicuous place of such town or village;  (c) a copy thereof shall be affixed to some conspicuous part of the Court-house;  (ii) the  Court  may  also,  if  it  thinks  fit,  direct  a  copy  of  the  proclamation  to  be  published  in  a  daily  newspaper circulating in the place in which such person ordinarily resides.   (3) A  statement in  writing by the  Court issuing the proclamation to the  effect that the  proclamation  was duly  published on a  specified day,  in the  manner  specified in clause (i) of sub-section (2), shall be  conclusive  evidence  that the requirements of this section have been complied with, and that the proclamation was published on such day.  1 [(4) Where  a  proclamation  published  under  sub-section  (1)  is  in  respect  of  a  person  accused  of  an  offence  punishable under section 302, 304, 364, 367, 382, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 402, 436, 449, 459 or  460 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), and such person fails to appear at the specified place and time required  by the proclamation, the Court may, after making such inquiry as it thinks fit, pronounce him a proclaimed offender  and make a declaration to that effect.                                                    1. Ins. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 12 (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).   44    (5) The  provisions  of  sub-sections  (2)  and  (3) shall apply  to  a  declaration  made  by  the  Court under  sub-section (4) as they apply to the proclamation published under sub-section (1).]  83.    Attachment  of  property  of  person  absconding.—(1) The  Court  issuing  a  proclamation  under  section 82 may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, at any time after the issue of the proclamation, order  the attachment of any property, movable or immovable, or both, belonging to the proclaimed person:  Provided that where at the time of the issue of the proclamation the Court is satisfied, by affidavit or  otherwise, that the person in relation to whom the proclamation is to be issued,—  (a) is about to dispose of the whole or any part of his property, or  (b) is  about  to  remove  the  whole  or  any  part  of  his  property  from  the  local  jurisdiction  of  the  Court,  it may order the attachment simultaneously with the issue of the proclamation.  (2) Such  order  shall  authorise  the  attachment  of  any  property  belonging  to  such  person  within  the  district in which it is made; and it shall authorise the attachment of any property belonging to such person  without  such  district  when  endorsed  by  the  District  Magistrate  within  whose  district  such  property  is  situate.  (3) If  the  property  ordered to  be  attached is  a  debt  or other  movable  property,  the  attachment  under  this section shall be made—  (a) by seizure; or  (b) by the appointment of a receiver; or  (c) by an order in writing prohibiting the delivery of such property to the proclaimed person or to  any one on his behalf; or  (d) by all or any two of such methods, as the Court thinks fit.  (4) If the property ordered to be attached is immovable, the attachment under this section shall, in the  case  of  land  paying  revenue  to  the  State  Government,  be  made  through  the  Collector  of  the  district  in  which the land is situate, and in all other cases—  (a) by taking possession; or  (b) by the appointment of a receiver; or  (c) by  an  order  in  writing  prohibiting  the  payment  of  rent  on  delivery  of  property  to  the  proclaimed person or to any one on his behalf; or  (d) by all or any two of such methods, as the Court thinks fit.  (5) If the property ordered to be attached consists of live-stock or is of a perishable nature, the Court  may, if it thinks it expedient, order immediate sale thereof, and in such case the proceeds of the sale shall  abide the order of the Court.   (6) The powers, duties and liabilities of a receiver appointed under this section shall be the same as  those of a receiver appointed under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908).  84. Claims and objections to attachment.—(1) If any claim is preferred to, or objection made to the  attachment  of,  any  property  attached  under  section  83, within  six  months  from  the  date  of  such  attachment, by any person other than the proclaimed person, on the ground that the claimant or objector  has  an  interest  in  such  property,  and  that  such  interest  is  not  liable  to  attachment  under  section  83,  the  claim or objection shall be inquired into, and may be allowed or disallowed in whole or in part:  Provided  that  any  claim  preferred  or  objection  made  within  the  period  allowed  by  this  sub-section  may, in the event of the death of the claimant or objector, be continued by his legal representative.   45    (2) Claims  or  objections  under sub-section (1) may  be  preferred  or  made  in  the  Court by  which  the  order of attachment is issued, or, if the claim or objection is in respect of property attached under an order  endorsed under sub-section (2) of section 83, in the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate of the district  in which the attachment is made.  (3) Every such claim or objection shall be inquired into by the Court in which it is preferred or made:  Provided  that, if it is  preferred  or made in the  Court of a  Chief Judicial Magistrate,  he  may  make  it  over for disposal to any Magistrate subordinate to him.  (4) Any person whose claim or objection has been disallowed in whole or in part by an order under  sub-section (1) may, within a period of one year from the date of such order, institute a suit to establish  the right which he claims in respect of the property in dispute; but subject to the result of such suit, if any,  the order shall be conclusive.  85.  Release,  sale  and  restoration  of  attached  property.—(1) If  the  proclaimed  person  appears  within the time specified in the proclamation, the Court shall make an order releasing the property from  the attachment.  (2) If  the  proclaimed  person  does  not  appear  within  the  time  specified  in  the  proclamation,  the  property  under  the  attachment  shall  be  at  the  disposal  of  the  State  Government;  but  it  shall  not  be  sold  until  the  expiration  of  six  months  from  the  date  of  the  attachment  and  until  any  claim  preferred  or  objection made under section 84 has been disposed of under that section, unless it is subject to speedy and  natural decay, or the Court considers that the sale would be for the benefit of the owner; in either of which  cases the Court may cause it to be sold whenever it thinks fit.  (3) If, within two years from the date of the attachment, any person whose property is or has been at  the  disposal  of  the  State  Government,  under  sub-section  (2),  appears  voluntarily  or  is  apprehended  and  brought before the Court by whose order the property was attached, or the Court to which such Court is  subordinate,  and  proves to the  satisfaction  of  such  Court that  he  did  not abscond  or conceal  himself  for  the purpose of avoiding execution of the warrant, and that he had not such notice of the proclamation as to  enable him to attend within the time specified therein, such property, or,  if  the  same  has  been  sold, the  net proceeds of the sale, or, if part only thereof has been sold, the net proceeds of the sale and the residue  of  the  property,  shall,  after  satisfying  therefrom  all  costs  incurred  in  consequence  of  the  attachment,  be  delivered to him.  86. Appeal from order rejecting application for  restoration of attached property.—Any person  referred  to  in  sub-section  (3)  of  section  85,  who  is  aggrieved  by  any  refusal  to  deliver  property  or  the  proceeds of the sale thereof may appeal to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the sentences of  the first-mentioned Court.  D.—Other rules regarding processes  87. Issue of warrant in lieu of, or in addition to, summons.—A Court may, in any case in which it  is empowered by this Code to issue a summons for the appearance of any person, issue, after recording its  reasons in writing, a warrant for his arrest—  (a) if, either before the issue of such summons, or after the issue of the same but before the time  fixed for his appearance, the Court sees reason to believe that he has absconded or will not obey the  summons; or  (b) if at such time he fails to appear and the summons is proved to have been duly served in time  to admit of his appearing in accordance therewith and no reasonable excuse is offered for such failure.  88.  Power  to  take  bond  for  appearance.—When  any  person  for  whose  appearance  or  arrest  the  officer presiding in any Court is empowered to issue a summons or warrant, is present in such Court, such  officer  may  require  such  person  to  execute  a  bond,  with  or  without  sureties,  for  his  appearance  in  such  Court, or any other Court to which the case may be transferred for trial.   46    89. Arrest on breach of bond for appearance.—When any person who is bound by any bond taken  under this Code to appear before a Court, does not appear, the officer presiding in such Court may issue a  warrant directing that such person be arrested and produced before him.  90. Provisions of this Chapter generally applicable to summonses and warrants of arrest.—The  provisions  contained  in  this  Chapter  relating  to  a  summons  and  warrant,  and  their  issue,  service  and  execution, shall, so far as may be, apply to every summons and every warrant of arrest issued under this  Code.  CHAPTER VII  PROCESSES TO COMPEL THE PRODUCTION OF THINGS  A.—Summons to produce  91.  Summons  to  produce  document  or  other  thing.—(1) Whenever  any  Court  or  any  officer  in  charge  of  a  police  station  considers  that  the  production  of  any  document  or  other  thing  is  necessary  or  desirable  for  the  purposes  of  any  investigation,  inquiry,  trial  or  other  proceeding  under  this  Code  by  or  before  such  Court  or  officer,  such  Court  may  issue  a  summons,  or  such  officer  a  written  order, to  the  person  in  whose  possession  or  power  such  document  or  thing  is  believed  to  be,  requiring  him  to  attend  and produce it, or to produce it, at the time and place stated in the summons or order.  (2) Any  person  required  under  this  section  merely  to  produce  a  document  or  other  thing  shall  be  deemed to have complied with the requisition if he causes such document or thing to be produced instead  of attending personally to produce the same.  (3) Nothing in this section shall be deemed—  (a) to affect sections 123 and 124 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872), or the Bankers’  Books Evidence Act, 1891 (13 of 1891), or  (b) to apply to a letter, postcard, telegram or other document or any parcel or thing in the custody  of the postal or telegraph authority.  92. Procedure as to letters and telegrams.—(1) If any document, parcel or thing in the custody of a  postal or telegraph authority is, in the opinion of the District Magistrate, Chief Judicial Magistrate, Court  of  Session or  High  Court wanted  for the  purpose  of any  investigation, inquiry, trial  or  other  proceeding  under this Code, such Magistrate or Court may require the postal or telegraph authority, as the case may  be, to deliver the document, parcel or thing to such person as the Magistrate or Court directs.  (2) If  any  such  document,  parcel  or  thing  is,  in  the  opinion  of  any  other  Magistrate,  whether  Executive or Judicial, or of any Commissioner of Police or District Superintendent of Police, wanted for  any such purpose, he may require the postal or telegraph authority, as the case may be, to cause search to  be made for and to detain such document, parcel or thing pending the order of a District Magistrate, Chief  Judicial Magistrate or Court under sub-section (1).  B.—Search-warrants  93.  When  search-warrant  may be  issued.—(1) (a) Where  any  Court  has  reason  to  believe  that  a  person to whom a summons order under section 91 or a requisition under sub-section (1) of section 92 has  been,  or  might  be,  addressed,  will  not  or  would  not produce  the  document  or  thing  as  required  by  such  summons or requisition, or  (b) where such document or thing is not known to the Court to be in the possession of any person, or   (c) where  the  Court  considers  that the  purposes  of  any  inquiry,  trial  or  other  proceeding  under this  Code  will be  served  by a  general  search  or  inspection,  it  may  issue  a  search-warrant;  and  the  person  to  whom  such  warrant  is  directed,  may  search  or  inspect  in  accordance  therewith  and  the  provisions  hereinafter contained.   47    (2) The Court may, if it thinks fit, specify in the warrant the particular place or part thereof to which  only  the  search  or  inspection  shall  extend;  and  the  person  charged  with  the  execution  of  such  warrant  shall then search or inspect only the place or part so specified.  (3) Nothing contained in this section shall authorise any Magistrate other than a District Magistrate or  Chief Judicial Magistrate to grant a warrant to search for a document, parcel or other thing in the custody  of the postal or telegraph authority.  94. Search of place suspected to contain stolen property, forged documents, etc.—(1) If a District  Magistrate,  Sub-divisional  Magistrate  or  Magistrate  of  the  first  class,  upon  information  and  after  such  inquiry as he thinks necessary, has reason to believe that any place is used for the deposit or sale of stolen  property, or for the deposit, sale or production of any objectionable article to which this section applies, or  that  any  such  objectionable  article  is  deposited  in  any  place,  he  may  by  warrant  authorise  any  police  officer above the rank of a constable—  (a) to enter, with such assistance as may be required, such place,  (b) to search the same in the manner specified in the warrant,  (c) to take possession of any property or article therein found which he reasonably suspects to be  stolen property or objectionable article to which this section applies,  (d) to convey such property or article before a Magistrate, or to guard the same on the spot until  the offender is taken before a Magistrate, or otherwise to dispose of it in some place of safety,  (e) to  take  into  custody  and  carry  before  a  Magistrate  every  person  found  in  such  place  who  appears to have been privy to the deposit, sale or production of any such property or article knowing  or having reasonable  cause to suspect it to be  stolen property or,  as the  case  may be,  objectionable  article to which this section applies.

(2)  If ingress into such place cannot be so obtained, the officer or other person executing the warrant  may proceed in the manner provided by sub-section (2) of section 47.    49    (3)  Where any person in or about such place is reasonably suspected of concealing about his person  any  article  for  which  search  should  be  made,  such  person  may    be  searched  and  if  such  person  is  a  woman, the search  shall be made by another woman with strict regard to decency.   (4) Before making a search under this Chapter, the officer or other person about to make it shall call  upon  two  or  more  independent  and  respectable  inhabitants  of  the  locality  in  which  the  place  to  be  searched  is  situate  or  of  any  other  locality  if  no  such  inhabitant  of  the  said  locality  is  available  or  is  willing to be a witness to the search, to attend and witness the search and may issue an order in writing to  them or any of them so to do.  (5) The  search  shall  be  made  in  their  presence,  and  a  list  of  all  things  seized  in  the  course  of  such  search  and  of the  places in which  they are  respectively found shall be  prepared  by such officer or other  person  and  signed  by  such  witnesses;  but  no  person  witnessing  a  search  under  this  section  shall  be  required to attend the Court as a witness of the search unless specially summoned by it.

(7) When any person is searched under sub-section (3), a list of all things taken possession of shall be  prepared, and a copy thereof shall be delivered to such person.  (8) Any  person  who,  without  reasonable  cause,  refuses  or  neglects  to  attend  and  witness  a  search  under this section, when called upon to do so by an order in writing delivered or tendered to him, shall be  deemed to have committed an offence under section 187 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).  101. Disposal  of  things  found  in  search  beyond  jurisdiction.—When,  in  the  execution  of  a             search-warrant at any place beyond the local jurisdiction of the Court which issued the same, any of the  things for which search is made, are found, such things, together with the list of the same prepared under  the  provisions  hereinafter  contained,  shall  be  immediately  taken  before  the  Court  issuing  the  warrant,  unless such place is nearer to the Magistrate having jurisdiction therein than to such Court, in which case  the list and things shall be immediately taken before such Magistrate; and, unless there be good cause to  the contrary, such Magistrate shall make an order authorising them to be taken to such Court.

Security for keeping the peace on conviction.—(1) When a Court of Session or Court of a Magistrate of  the  first class convicts a  person of any of  the offences  specified in  sub-section (2) or of abetting any  such offence  and is of opinion that it is necessary to take security from such person for keeping the peace, the Court may, at the  time of passing sentence on such person, order him to execute a bond, with or without sureties, for keeping the peace  for such period, not exceeding three years, as it thinks fit.  (2) The offences referred to in sub-section (1) are—  (a) any offence punishable under Chapter VIII of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), other than an offence  punishable under section 153A or section 153B or section 154 thereof;  (b) any offence which consists of, or includes, assault or using criminal force or committing mischief;  (c) any offence of criminal intimidation;  (d) any other offence which caused, or was intended or known to be likely to cause, a breach of the peace.  (3) If the conviction is set aside on appeal or otherwise, the bond so executed shall become void.  (4) An  order  under  this  section  may  also  be  made  by  an  Appellate  Court  or  by  a  Court  when  exercising  its  powers of revision.  107. Security for keeping the peace in other cases.—(1) When an Executive Magistrate receives information  that any person is likely to commit a breach of the peace or disturb the public tranquillity or to do any wrongful act  that  may  probably  occasion  a  breach  of  the  peace  or  disturb  the  public  tranquillity  and  is  of  opinion  that  there  is  sufficient  ground  for  proceeding,  he  may,  in  the  manner  hereinafter  provided,  require  such  person  to  show  cause  why he should not be ordered to execute a bond  1 [with or without sureties,] for keeping the peace for such period,  not exceeding one year, as the Magistrate thinks fit.  (2) Proceedings under this section may be taken before any Executive Magistrate when either the place where  the  breach  of  the  peace  or  disturbance  is  apprehended  is  within  his  local  jurisdiction  or  there  is  within  such  jurisdiction  a  person  who  is  likely  to  commit  a  breach  of  the  peace  or  disturb  the  public  tranquillity  or  to  do  any  wrongful act as aforesaid beyond such jurisdiction.  108. Security for good behaviour from persons disseminating seditious matters.—(1) When  2 [an Executive  Magistrate]  receives information that  there  is  within his local jurisdiction any person  who,  within or  without  such  jurisdiction,—  (i) either orally or in writing or in any other manner, intentionally disseminates or attempts to disseminate  or abets the dissemination of,—  (a) any  matter  the  publication  of  which  is  punishable  under  section  124A  or  section  153A  or  section  153B  or section 295A of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), or  (b) any  matter  concerning  a  Judge  acting  or  purporting  to  act  in  the  discharge  of  his  official  duties  which amounts to criminal intimidation or defamation under the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860),  (ii) makes,   produces,   publishes   or   keeps   for   sale,   imports,   exports, conveys,   sells,   lets   to   hire,                    distributes, publicly exhibits or in any other manner puts into circulation any obscene matter such as is referred  to in section 292 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860),  and  the  Magistrate  is  of  opinion  that  there  is  sufficient  ground  for  proceeding,  the  Magistrate  may,  in  the  manner  hereinafter  provided,  require  such  person  to  show  cause  why  he  should  not  be  ordered  to  execute  a  bond,  with  or  without sureties, for his good behaviour for such period, not exceeding one year, as the Magistrate thinks fit.                                                    1. Ins. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 11 (w.e.f. 18-12-1978).   2. Subs. by Act 63 of 1980, s. 2, for “a Judicial Magistrate  of the first class” (w.e.f. 23-9-1980).   55     (2) No proceedings shall be  taken under this section against the  editor, proprietor, printer or publisher of any  publication registered under, and edited, printed and published in conformity with, the rules laid down in the Press  and Registration of Books Act, 1867 (25 of 1867), with reference to any matter contained in such publication except  by the order or under the authority of the State Government or some officer empowered by the State Government in  this behalf.  109.  Security  for  good  behaviour  from  suspected  persons.—When  1 [an  Executive  Magistrate]    receives  information  that  there  is  within  his  local  jurisdiction  a  person  taking  precautions  to  conceal  his  presence  and  that  there is reason to believe that he is doing so with a view to committing a cognizable offence, the Magistrate may, in  the manner hereinafter provided, require such person to show cause why he should not be ordered to execute a bond,  with or without sureties, for his good behaviour for such period, not exceeding one year, as the Magistrate thinks fit.  110.  Security  for  good  behaviour  from  habitual  offenders.—When  1 [an  Executive  Magistrate]    receives  information that there is within his local jurisdiction a person who—   (a) is by habit a robber, house-breaker, thief, or forger, or  (b) is by habit a receiver of stolen property knowing the same to have been stolen, or  (c) habitually protects or harbours thieves, or aids in the concealment or disposal of stolen property, or  (d) habitually  commits,  or  attempts  to  commit,  or  abets  the  commission  of,  the  offence  of  kidnapping,  abduction,  extortion,  cheating  or  mischief,  or  any  offence  punishable  under  Chapter  XII  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code (45 of 1860), or under section 489A, section 489B, section 489C or section 489D of that Code, or  (e) habitually commits, or attempts to commit, or abets the commission of, offences, involving a breach of  the peace, or  (f) habitually commits, or attempts to commit, or abets the commission of—  (i) any offence under one or more of the following Acts, namely:—  (a)  the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 (23 of 1940);  2 [(b) the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 (46 of 1973);]  (c) the Employees’ Provident Fund  3 [and Family Pension Fund] Act, 1952 (19 of 1952);  (d) the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (37 of 1954);  (e) the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 (10 of 1955);  (f) the Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955 (22 of 1955);  (g) the Customs Act, 1962 (52 of 1962);  4 ***  5 [(h) the Foreigners Act, 1946 (31 of 1946); or]  (ii) any  offence  punishable  under  any  other  law  providing  for  the  prevention  of  hoarding  or  profiteering or of adulteration of food or drugs or of corruption, or   (g) is so desperate and dangerous to render his being at large without security hazardous to the community,  such Magistrate  may, in the  manner hereinafter provided, require such person to show cause  why he should not be  ordered to execute  a bond,  with  sureties,  for his  good behaviour  for such period, not exceeding three  years, as the  Magistrate thinks fit.                                                    1. Subs. by Act 63 of 1980, s. 2, for “a Judicial Magistrate of the first class” (w.e.f. 23-9-1980).  2. Subs. by Act 56 of 1974, s. 3 and the Second Sch., for item (b) (w.e.f. 10-1-1975).  3.

Order to be made.—When a Magistrate acting under section 107, section 108, section 109 or section 110,  deems it necessary to require any person to show cause under such section, he shall make an order in writing, setting  forth the substance of the information received, the amount of the bond to be executed, the term for which it is to be  in force, and the number, character and class of sureties (if any) required.  112. Procedure in respect of person present in Court.—If the person in respect of whom such order is made  is present in Court, it shall be read over to him, or, if he so desires, the substance thereof shall be explained to him.  113.  Summons  or  warrant  in  case  of  person  not  so  present.—If  such  person  is  not  present  in  Court,  the  Magistrate  shall issue  a  summons requiring  him to appear, or, when such person is in custody, a  warrant directing  the officer in whose custody he is to bring him before the Court:  Provided  that  whenever  it  appears  to  such  Magistrate,  upon  the  report  of  a  police  officer  or  upon  other  information (the substance of which report or information shall be recorded by the Magistrate), that there is reason  to  fear  the  commission  of  a  breach  of  the  peace,  and  that  such  breach  of  the  peace  cannot  be  prevented  otherwise  than by the immediate arrest of such person, the Magistrate may at any time issue a warrant for his arrest.  114. Copy of order to accompany summons or  warrant.—Every  summons or  warrant issued  under  section  113 shall be accompanied by a copy of the order made under section 111, and such copy shall be delivered by the  officer serving or executing such summons or warrant to the person served with, or arrested under, the same.  115. Power to dispense with personal attendance.—The Magistrate may, if he sees sufficient cause, dispense  with  the  personal  attendance  of  any  person  called  upon  to  show  cause  why  he  should  not  be  ordered  to  execute  a  bond for keeping the peace or for good behaviour and may permit him to appear by a pleader.  116.  Inquiry  as  to  truth  of  information.—(1) When  an  order  under  section  111  has  been  read  or  explained  under  section  112  to  a  person  present  in  Court,  or  when  any  person  appears  or  is  brought  before  a  Magistrate  in  compliance with, or in execution of, a summons or warrant, issued under section 113, the Magistrate shall proceed  to inquire  into the  truth of the information upon  which action has been taken, and to take  such  further evidence as  may appear necessary.  (2) Such  inquiry  shall  be  made,  as  nearly  as  may  be  practicable,  in  the  manner  hereinafter  prescribed  for  conducting trial and recording evidence in summons-cases.  (3) After the commencement, and before the completion, of the inquiry under sub-section (1), the Magistrate,  if he considers that immediate measures are necessary for the prevention of a breach of the peace or disturbance  of  the  public  tranquillity  or  the  commission  of  any  offence  or  for  the  public  safety,  may,  for  reasons  to  be  recorded in writing, direct the person in respect of whom the order under section 111 has been made to execute a  bond,  with  or  without  sureties,  for  keeping  the  peace  or maintaining  good  behaviour  until  the  conclusion  of  the  inquiry, and may detain him in custody until such bond is executed or, in default of execution, until the inquiry is  concluded:  Provided that—  (a) no person against whom proceedings are not being taken under section 108, section 109, or section 110  shall be directed to execute a bond for maintaining good behaviour;  (b) the  conditions of  such bond,  whether as to the amount  thereof or as to the  provision  of sureties or the  number thereof or the pecuniary extent of their liability,  shall not be  more  onerous than  those  specified in the  order under section 111.  (4) For the purposes of this section the fact that a person is an habitual offender or is so desperate and dangerous  as to render his being at large without security hazardous to the community may be proved by evidence of general  repute or otherwise.  (5) Where  two  or  more  persons  have  been  associated  together  in  the  matter  under inquiry,  they  may  be  dealt  within the same or separate inquiries as the Magistrate shall think just.   57    (6) The  inquiry  under  this  section  shall  be  completed  within  a  period  of  six  months  from  the  date  of  its  commencement, and if such inquiry is not so completed, the proceedings under this Chapter shall, on the expiry of  the  said  period,  stand  terminated  unless,  for  special  reasons  to  be  recorded  in  writing,  the  Magistrate  otherwise  directs:  Provided  that  where  any  person  has  been  kept  in  detention  pending  such  inquiry,  the  proceeding  against  that  person, unless terminated earlier, shall stand terminated on the expiry of a period of six months of such detention.  (7) Where  any direction is  made  under sub-section (6) permitting the  continuance of proceedings the Sessions  Judge may, on an application made to him by the aggrieved party, vacate such direction if he is satisfied that it was  not based on any special reason or was perverse.  117. Order to give  security.—If,  upon such inquiry, it is  proved that  it is necessary  for keeping the peace or  maintaining  good  behaviour,  as  the  case  may  be,  that  the  person  in  respect  of  whom  the  inquiry  is  made  should  execute a bond, with or without sureties, the Magistrate shall make an order accordingly:  Provided that—  (a) no person shall be ordered to give security of a nature different from, or of an amount larger than, or for  a period longer than, that specified in the order made under section 111;  (b) the amount of every bond shall be fixed with due regard to the circumstances of the case and shall not  be excessive;  (c) when the person in respect of whom the inquiry is made is a minor, the bond shall be executed only by  his sureties.  118.  Discharge  of  person  informed  against.—If,  on  an  inquiry  under  section  116,  it  is  not  proved  that  it  is  necessary  for  keeping  the  peace  or  maintaining  good  behaviour,  as  the  case  may  be,  that  the  person  in  respect  of  whom the  inquiry is  made, should execute  a bond, the Magistrate  shall  make an entry on the record to that  effect,  and if such person is in custody only  for the  purposes of the  inquiry,  shall release  him, or, if such person is  not in  custody, shall discharge him.  119.  Commencement  of  period  for  which  security  is  required.—(1) If  any  person,  in  respect  of  whom  an  order requiring security is made under section 106 or section 117, is at the time such order is made, sentenced to, or  undergoing  a  sentence  of,  imprisonment,  the  period  for  which  such  security  is  required  shall  commence  on  the  expiration of such sentence.  (2) In  other  cases  such  period  shall  commence  on  the  date  of  such  order  unless  the  Magistrate,  for  sufficient  reason, fixes a later date.  120. Contents of bond.—The bond to be executed by any such person shall bind him to keep the peace or to be  of good behaviour, as the case may be, and in the latter case the commission or attempt to commit, or the abetment  of, any offence punishable with imprisonment, wherever it may be committed, is a breach of the bond.  121.  Power  to  reject  sureties.—(1) A  Magistrate  may  refuse  to  accept  any  surety  offered,  or  may  reject  any  surety previously accepted by him or his predecessor under this  Chapter on the  ground that  such surety is an  unfit  person for the purposes of the bond:  Provided that, before so refusing to accept or rejecting any such surety, he  shall either himself hold an inquiry  on  oath  into  the  fitness  of  the  surety,  or  cause  such  inquiry  to  be  held  and  a  report  to  be  made  thereon  by  a  Magistrate subordinate to him.  (2) Such Magistrate shall, before holding the inquiry, give reasonable notice to the surety and to the person by  whom the surety was offered and shall, in making the inquiry, record the substance of the evidence adduced before  him.  (3) If  the  Magistrate  is  satisfied,  after  considering  the  evidence  so  adduced  either  before him  or  before  a  Magistrate deputed under sub-section (1), and the report of such Magistrate (if any), that the surety is an unfit person  for the purposes of the bond, he shall make an order refusing to accept or rejecting, as the case may be, such surety  and recording his reasons for so doing:   58    Provided  that,  before  making  an  order  rejecting  any  surety  who  has  previously  been  accepted,  the  Magistrate  shall issue his summons or warrant, as he thinks fit, and cause the person for whom the surety is bound to appear or  to be brought before him.  122. Imprisonment in default of security.—(1) (a) If any person ordered to give security under section 106 or  section 117 does not give  such security on or before  the  date  on  which  the  period for  which such security is to be  given  commences,  he  shall,  except  in  the  case  next  hereinafter  mentioned,  be  committed  to  prison,  or,  if  he  is  already in prison, be detained in prison until such period expires or until within such period he gives the security to  the Court or Magistrate who made the order requiring it.  (b) If any person after having executed a  1 [bond, with or without sureties] without sureties for keeping the peace  in pursuance of an order of a  Magistrate  under section 117, is proved, to the  satisfaction  of such Magistrate  or his  successor-in-office,  to  have  committed  breach  of  the  bond,  such  Magistrate  or  successor-in-office  may,  after  recording the grounds of such proof, order that the person be arrested and detained in prison until the expiry of the  period of the bond and such order shall be without prejudice to any other punishment or forfeiture to which the said  person may be liable in accordance with law.  (2) When such person has been ordered by a Magistrate to give security for a period exceeding one  year, such  Magistrate shall, if such person does not give such security as aforesaid, issue a warrant directing him to be detained  in prison pending the orders of the Sessions Judge and the proceedings shall be laid, as soon as conveniently may be,  before such Court.  (3) Such Court, after examining such proceedings and requiring from the Magistrate any further information or  evidence which it thinks necessary, and after giving the concerned person a reasonable opportunity of being heard,  may pass such order on the case as it thinks fit:  Provided that the period (if any) for which any person is imprisoned for failure to give security shall not exceed  three years.  (4) If  security  has  been  required  in  the  course  of  the  same  proceeding  from  two  or  more  persons  in  respect                  of  any  one  of  whom  the  proceedings  are  referred  to  the  Sessions  Judge  under  sub-section (2) such  reference  shall  also  include  the  case  of  any  other  of  such  persons  who  has  been  order  to  give  security,  and  the  provisions  of                   sub-sections (2) and (3) shall,  in  that  event,  apply  to  the  case  of  such  other  person  also,  except  that  the  period  (if  any) for which he may be imprisoned, shall not exceed the period for which he was ordered to give security.  (5) A  Sessions  Judge  may  in  his  discretion  transfer  any  proceedings  laid  before  him  under  sub-section (2) or  sub-section (4) to an Additional Sessions Judge or Assistant Sessions Judge and upon such transfer, such Additional  Sessions  Judge  or  Assistant  Sessions  Judge  may  exercise  the  powers  of  a  Sessions  Judge  under  this  section  in  respect of such proceedings.  (6) If the security is tendered to the officer in charge of the jail, he shall forthwith refer the matter to the Court  or Magistrate who made the order, and shall await the orders of such Court or Magistrate.  (7) Imprisonment for failure to give security for keeping the peace shall be simple.  (8) Imprisonment for failure  to give security for good behaviour shall,  where the proceedings have been taken  under  section  108,  be  simple,  and, where  the  proceedings  have  been  taken  under  section  109  or  section  110,  be  rigorous or simple as the Court or Magistrate in each case directs.  123.  Power  to  release  persons  imprisoned  for  failing  to  give  security.—(1) Whenever  2 [the  District  Magistrate  in the  case  of  an  order  passed  by  an  Executive  Magistrate  under  section  117,  or  the  Chief  Judicial  Magistrate in any other case] is of opinion that any person imprisoned for failing to give security under this Chapter  may  be  released  without  hazard  to  the  community  or  to  any  other  person,  he  may  order  such  person  to  be  discharged.                                                    1. Subs. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 15, for “bond without sureties” (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).  2. Subs. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 12, for “the Chief Judicial Magistrate”  (w.e.f. 18-12-1978).   59    (2) Whenever any person has been imprisoned for failing to give security under this Chapter, the High Court or  Court  of  Session,  or,  where  the  order  was  made  by  any  other  Court,  1 [District  Magistrate,  in  the  case  of  an  order  passed by an Executive Magistrate under section 117, or the Chief Judicial Magistrate in any other case], may make  an  order  reducing  the  amount  of  the  security  or  the  number  of  sureties  or  the  time  for  which  security  has  been  required.  (3) An  order  under  sub-section (1) may  direct  the  discharge  of  such  person  either  without  conditions  or  upon  any conditions which such person accepts:  Provided  that  any  condition  imposed  shall  cease  to  be  operative  when  the  period  for  which  such  person  was  ordered to give security has expired.  (4) The State Government may prescribe the conditions upon which a conditional discharge may be made.  (5) If any condition upon which any person has been discharged is, in the opinion of  1 [District Magistrate, in the  case of an order passed by an Executive Magistrate under section 117, or the Chief Judicial Magistrate in any other  case] by whom the order of discharge was made or of his successor, not fulfilled, he may cancel the same.  (6) When  a conditional  order  of  discharge  has  been  cancelled  under  sub-section (5), such  person  may  be  arrested by any police officer without warrant, and shall thereupon be produced before the  1 [District Magistrate, in  the  case  of  an  order  passed  by  an  Executive  Magistrate  under  section  117, or  the  Chief  Judicial  Magistrate  in  any  other case].  (7) Unless  such  person  gives  security  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  original  order  for  the  unexpired  portion of the term for which he  was in the  first instance committed  or ordered to be detained (such portion being  deemed to be a period equal to the period between the date of the breach of the conditions of discharge and the date  on which, except for such conditional discharge, he would have been entitled to release),  1 [District Magistrate, in the  case of an order  passed by an Executive Magistrate under section 117, or the Chief Judicial Magistrate in any other  case] may remand such person to prison to undergo such unexpired portion.  (8) A  person  remanded  to  prison  under  sub-section (7) shall,  subject  to  the  provisions  of  section  122,  be  released at any time on giving security in accordance with the terms of the original order for the unexpired portion  aforesaid to the Court or Magistrate by whom such order was made, or to its or his successor.  (9) The High Court or Court of Session may at any time, for sufficient reasons to be recorded in writing, cancel  any  bond  for  keeping  the  peace  or  for  good  behaviour  executed  under  this  Chapter  by  any  order  made  by  it,  and  1 [District  Magistrate,  in  the  case  of  an  order  passed  by  an  Executive  Magistrate  under  section  117,  or  the  Chief  Judicial Magistrate in any other case] may make such cancellation where such bond was executed under his order or  under the order of any other Court in his district.  (10) Any surety for the peaceable conduct or good behaviour of another person ordered to execute a bond under  this Chapter may at any time apply to the Court making such order to cancel the bond and on such application being  made, the Court shall issue a summons or warrant, as it thinks fit, requiring the person for whom such surety is bond  appear or to be brought before it.  124. Security for unexpired period of bond.—(1) When a person for whose appearance a summons or warrant  has been issued under the proviso to sub-section (3) of section 121 or under sub-section (10) of section 123, appears  or is brought before the Magistrate or Court, the Magistrate or Court shall cancel the bond executed by such person  and shall order such person to give, for the  unexpired portion of the  term of such bond, fresh  security of the  same  description as the original security.  (2) Every  such  order  shall,  for  the  purposes  of  sections  120  to  123  (both  inclusive)  be  deemed  to  be  an  order  made under section 106 or section 117, as the case may be.                                                    1. Subs. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 12, for “Chief Judicial Magistrate”   (w.e.f. 18-12-1978).   60    CHAPTER IX  ORDER FOR MAINTENANCE OF WIVES, CHILDREN AND PARENTS  125.  Order  for  maintenance  of  wives,  children  and  parents.—(1) If  any  person  having  sufficient  means  neglects or refuses to maintain—  (a) his wife, unable to maintain herself, or  (b) his legitimate or illegitimate minor child, whether married or not, unable to maintain itself, or  (c) his legitimate or illegitimate child (not being a married daughter) who has attained majority, where such  child is, by reason of any physical or mental abnormality or injury unable to maintain itself, or  (d) his father or mother, unable to maintain himself or herself,  a  Magistrate  of  the  first  class  may,  upon  proof  of  such  neglect  or  refusal,  order  such  person  to  make  a  monthly  allowance  for  the  maintenance  of  his  wife  or  such  child,  father  or  mother,  at  such  monthly  rate  1  *  *  *   as  such  Magistrate thinks fit and to pay the same to such person as the Magistrate may from time to time direct:  Provided that the Magistrate may order the father of a minor female child referred to in clause (b) to make such  allowance, until she attains her majority, if the Magistrate is satisfied that the husband of such minor female child, if  married, is not possessed of sufficient means:  2 [Provided further that the Magistrate may, during the pendency of the proceeding regarding monthly allowance  for  the  maintenance  under  this  sub-section,  order  such  person  to  make  a  monthly  allowance  for  the  interim  maintenance of his wife or such child, father or mother, and the expenses of such proceeding which the Magistrate  considers reasonable, and to pay the same to such person as the Magistrate may from time to time direct:  Provided  also  that  an  application  for  the  monthly  allowance  for  the  interim  maintenance  and  expenses  of  proceeding under the second proviso shall, as far as possible, be disposed of within sixty days from the date of the  service of notice of the application to such person.]  Explanation.—For the purposes of this Chapter,—  (a) “minor” means a person who, under  the  provisions  of  the  Indian  Majority  Act,  1875  (9  of  1875)  is  deemed not to have attained his majority;  (b) “wife” includes a woman who has been divorced by, or has obtained a divorce from, her husband and  has not remarried.  3 [(2) Any  such  allowance  for  the  maintenance  or  interim  maintenance  and  expenses  of  proceeding  shall  be  payable  from  the  date  of  the  order,  or,  if  so  ordered,  from  the  date  of  the  application  for  maintenance  or  interim  maintenance and expenses of proceeding, as the case may be.]  (3) If any person so ordered fails without sufficient cause  to comply with the order, any such Magistrate  may,  for every breach of the order, issue a warrant for levying the amount due in the manner provided for levying fines,  and  may  sentence  such  person, for the whole or any part of each month’s  4 [allowance  for  the  maintenance  or  the  interim  maintenance and expenses of proceeding, as the  case  may be,] remaining  unpaid  after the  execution of the  warrant, to imprisonment for a term which may extend to one month or until payment if sooner made:  Provided  that  no  warrant  shall  be  issued  for  the  recovery  of  any  amount  due  under  this  section  unless  application be made to the Court to levy such amount within a period of one year from the date on which it became  due:                                                    1. Certain words omitted by Act 50 of  2001, s. 2  (w.e.f. 24-9-2001).  2. Ins. by s. 2, ibid. (w.e.f. 24-9-2001).  3. Subs. by s. 2, ibid., for sub-section (2) (w.e.f. 24-9-2001).  4. Subs. by s. 2, ibid., for “allowance” (w.e.f. 24-9-2001)    61    Provided  further  that  if  such  person  offers  to  maintain  his  wife  on  condition  of  her  living  with  him,  and  she  refuses to live with him, such Magistrate may consider any grounds of refusal stated by her, and may make an order  under this section notwithstanding such offer, if he is satisfied that there is just ground for so doing.  Explanation.—If  a  husband  has  contracted  marriage  with  another  woman  or  keeps  a  mistress,  it  shall  be  considered to be just ground for his wife’s refusal to live with him.  (4) No  wife  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  an  1 [allowance  for  the  maintenance  or  the  interim  maintenance  and  expenses of proceeding, as the case  may be,] from her husband under this section if she is living in adultery, or if,  without  any  sufficient  reason,  she  refuses  to  live  with  her  husband,  or  if  they  are  living  separately  by  mutual  consent.  (5) On proof that any wife in whose favour an order has been made under this section in living in adultery,  or  that  without  sufficient  reason  she  refuses  to  live  with  her husband,  or  that  they  are  living  separately  by  mutual  consent.  126.  Procedure.—(1) Proceedings under section 125 may be taken against any person in any district—  (a) where he is, or   (b) where he or his wife resides, or  (c) where he last resided with his wife, or as the case may be, with the mother of the illegitimate child.  (2) All  evidence  in  such  proceedings  shall  be  taken  in  the  presence  of  the  person  against  whom  an  order  for  payment of maintenance is proposed to be made, or, when his personal attendance is dispensed with, in the presence  of his pleader, and shall be recorded in the manner prescribed  for summons-cases:   Provided that if the  Magistrate is  satisfied that the person against whom an order for payment of maintenance  is proposed to be  made  is  wilfully avoiding service, or  wilfully neglecting to attend the  Court,  the  Magistrate  may   proceed to hear and determine the case ex parte and any order so made may be set aside for good cause shown on an  application made  within three months  from the date thereof subject to such terms including terms as to payment of  costs to the opposite party as the Magistrate may think just and proper.  (3) The Court in dealing with applications under section 125 shall have power to make such order as to costs as  may be just.  127. Alteration in allowance.— 2 [(1) On proof of a change in the circumstances of any person, receiving, under  section 125 a monthly allowance for the maintenance or interim maintenance, or ordered under the same section to  pay  a  monthly  allowance  for  the  maintenance,  or  interim  maintenance,  to  his  wife,  child,  father  or  mother,  as  the  case may be, the Magistrate may make such alteration, as he thinks fit, in the allowance for the maintenance or the  interim maintenance, as the case may be.]  (2) Where  it  appears  to  the  Magistrate  that,  in  consequence  of  any  decision  of  a  competent  Civil  Court,  any  order made  under section 125 should be  cancelled or varied, he  shall cancel the  order or, as the  case  may be, vary  the same accordingly.  (3) Where any order has been made under section 125 in favour of a woman who has been divorced by, or has  obtained a divorce from, her husband, the Magistrate shall, if he is satisfied that—  (a) the  woman  has,  after  the  date  of  such  divorce,  remarried,  cancel  such  order as  from  the  date  of  her  remarriage;                                                    1. Subs. by Act 50 of  2001, s. 2, for “allowance” (w.e.f. 24-9-2001).  2. Subs. by s. 3, ibid., for sub-section (1) (w.e.f. 24-9-2001).   62    (b) the woman has been divorced by her husband and that she has received, whether before or after the date  of  the  said  order,  the  whole  of  the  sum  which,  under  any  customary  or  personal  law  applicable  to  the  parties,  was payable on such divorce, cancel such order,—   (i) in  the  case  where  such  sum  was  paid  before  such  order,  from  the  date  on  which  such  order  was  made:  (ii) in  any  other  case,  from  the  date  of  expiry  of  the  period,  if  any,  for  which  maintenance  has  been  actually paid by the husband to the woman;  (c) the woman has obtained a divorce from her husband and that she had voluntarily surrendered her rights  to  1 [maintenance or interim maintenance, as the case may be,] after her divorce, cancel the order from the date  thereof.   (4) At the time of making any decree for the recovery of any maintenance or dowry by any person, to whom a  2 [monthly  allowance  for  the  maintenance  and  interim  maintenance  or  any  of  them  has  been  ordered]  to  be  paid  under  section  125,  the  Civil  Court  shall  take  into  account  the  sum  which  has  been  paid  to,  or  recovered  by,  such  person  2 [as monthly allowance for the maintenance and interim maintenance or  any of them, as the case may be, in  pursuance of] the said order.   128.  Enforcement  of  order  of maintenance.—A  copy  of  the  order  of  3 [maintenance  or  interim  maintenance  and expenses of proceedings, as the case may be,] shall be given without payment to the person in whose favour it is  made, or to his guardian, if any, or to the person to  4 [whom the allowance for the maintenance or the allowance for  the  interim  maintenance  and  expenses  of  proceeding, as  the  case  may  be,]  is  to  be  paid;  and  such  order  may  be  enforced  by  any  Magistrate  in  any  place  where  the  person  against  whom  it  is  made  may  be,  on    such  Magistrate  being  satisfied  as  to  the    identity  of  the  parties  and  the  non-payment  of  the  5 [allowance,  or  as  the  case  may  be,  expenses, due].     CHAPTER X  MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC ORDER AND TRANQUILLITY  A.—Unlawful assemblies  129.  Dispersal  of  assembly  by  use  of  civil  force.—(1) Any  Executive  Magistrate  or  officer  in  charge  of  a  police station or, in the absence of such officer in charge, any police officer, not below the rank of a sub-inspector,  may command any unlawful assembly, or any assembly of five or more persons likely to cause a disturbance of the  public  peace,  to  disperse;  and  it  shall  thereupon  be  the  duty  of  the  members  of  such  assembly  to  disperse  accordingly.  (2) If, upon being so commanded, any such assembly does not disperse, or if, without being so commanded, it  conducts  itself  in  such  a  manner  as  to  show  a  determination  not  to  disperse,  any  Executive  Magistrate  or  police  officer  referred  to  in  sub-section (1),  may  proceed  to  disperse  such  assembly  by  force,  and  may  require  the  assistance  of  any  male  person,  not  being  an  officer  or  member  of  the  armed  forces  and  acting  as  such,  for  the  purpose  of dispersing such assembly, and, if necessary, arresting and confining the  persons  who form part of it,  in  order to disperse such assembly or that they may be punished according to law.  130. Use of armed forces to disperse assembly.—(1) If any such assembly cannot be otherwise dispersed, and  if it is necessary for the public security that it should be dispersed, the Executive Magistrate of the highest rank who  is present may cause it to be dispersed by the armed forces.                                                    1. Subs. by Act 50 of 2001,  s. 3.,  for “maintenance”  (w.e.f. 24-9-2001).  2. Subs. by s. 3, ibid., for certain words  (w.e.f. 24-9-2001)  3. Subs. by s. 4, ibid., for “maintenance”  (w.e.f. 24-9-2001).  4. Subs. by s. 4, ibid., for “whom the allowance”  (w.e.f. 24-9-2001).   5. Subs. by s. 4, ibid., for “allowance due”  (w.e.f. 24-9-2001).     63    (2) Such Magistrate may require any officer in command of any group of persons belonging to the armed forces  to  disperse  the  assembly  with  the  help  of  the  armed  forces  under  his  command,  and  to  arrest  and  confine such  persons forming part of it as the  Magistrate  may direct,  or as it  may be  necessary to arrest and confine  in order to  disperse the assembly or to have them punished according to law.  (3) Every such officer of the armed forces shall obey such requisition in such manner as he thinks fit, but in so  doing he shall use as little force, and do as little injury to person and property, as may be consistent with dispersing  the assembly and arresting and detaining such persons.  131.  Power of  certain  armed  force  officers  to  disperse  assembly.—When  the  public  security  is  manifestly  endangered  by  any  such  assembly  and  no  Executive  Magistrate  can  be  communicated  with,  any  commissioned  or  gazetted  officer  of  the  armed  forces  may  disperse  such  assembly  with  the  help  of  the  armed  forces  under  his  command, and may arrest and confine any person forming part of it, in order to disperse such assembly or that they  may  be  punished  according  to  law;  but  if,  while  he  is  acting  under  this  section,  it  becomes  practicable  for  him  to  communicate  with  an  Executive  Magistrate,  he  shall  do  so,  and  shall  thenceforward  obey  the  instructions  of  the  Magistrate, as to whether he shall or shall not continue such action.  132.  Protection  against  prosecution  for  acts  done under  preceding  sections.—(1) No  prosecution  against  any person for any act purporting to be done under section 129, section 130 or section 131 shall be instituted in any  Criminal Court except—  (a) with the  sanction of the  Central  Government  where  such person is an officer or  member of the  armed  forces;  (b) with the sanction of the State Government in any other case.  (2) (a) No Executive Magistrate or police officer acting under any of the said sections in good faith;  (b) no person doing any act in good faith in compliance with a requisition under section 129 or section 130;  (c) no officer of the armed forces acting under section 131 in good faith;  (d) no member of the armed forces doing any act in obedience to any order which he was bound to obey,  shall be deemed to have thereby committed an offence.  (3) In this section and in the preceding sections of this Chapter,—  (a) the expression “armed forces” means the military, naval and air forces, operating as land forces and  includes any other armed forces of the Union so operating;  (b) “officer”, in relation to the armed forces, means a person commissioned, gazetted or in pay as an officer  of  the  armed  forces  and  includes  a  junior  commissioned  officer,  a  warrant  officer,  a  petty  officer,  a  non- commissioned officer and a non-gazetted officer;  (c) “member”, in relation to the armed forces, means a person in the armed forces other than an officer.  B.—Public nuisances  133.  Conditional  order  for  removal  of  nuisance.—(1) Whenever  a  District  Magistrate  or  a  Sub-divisional  Magistrate  or  any  other    Executive    Magistrate  specially  empowered  in  this  behalf  by  the  State  Government,  on  receiving  the  report  of  a  police  officer  or  other  information  and  on  taking  such  evidence  (if  any)  as  he  thinks  fit,  considers—  (a) that  any unlawful obstruction or nuisance should be  removed from any public place or from any  way,  river or channel which is or may be lawfully used by the public; or  (b) that the conduct of any trade or occupation, or the keeping of any goods or merchandise, is injurious to  the  health  or  physical  comfort  of  the  community,  and  that  in  consequence  such  trade  or occupation  should  be  prohibited or regulated or such goods or merchandise should be removed or the keeping thereof regulated; or   64    (c) that  the  construction  of  any building,  or,  the  disposal  of  any  substance,  as  is  likely  to  occasion  configuration or explosion, should be prevented or stopped; or  (d) that any building, tent or structure, or any tree is in such a condition that it is likely to fall and thereby  cause  injury  to  persons  living  or  carrying  on  business  in  the  neighbourhood  or  passing  by,  and  that in  consequence the removal, repair or support of such building, tent or structure, or the removal or support of such  tree, is necessary; or  (e) that  any  tank,  well or  excavation  adjacent  to  any  such  way  or  public  place  should  be  fenced  in  such   manner as to prevent danger arising to the public; or  (f) that any dangerous animal should be destroyed, confined or otherwise disposed of,  such Magistrate may make a conditional order requiring the person causing such obstruction or nuisance, or carrying  on such trade or occupation, or keeping any such goods or merchandise, or owning, possessing or controlling such  building, tent,  structure, substance, tank, well or excavation, or owning or possessing such animal or tree,  within a  time to be fixed in the order—  (i) to remove such obstruction or nuisance; or  (ii) to desist from carrying on, or to remove  or regulate  in  such  manner as  may be  directed, such  trade  or  occupation, or to remove such goods or merchandise, or to regulate the keeping thereof in such manner as may  be directed; or  (iii) to prevent or stop the construction of such building, or to alter the disposal of such substance; or  (iv) to remove, repair or support such building, tent or structure, or to remove or support such trees; or  (v) to fence such tank, well or excavation; or  (vi) to destroy, confine or dispose of such dangerous animal in the manner provided in the said order,  or, if he objects so to do, to appear before himself or some other Executive Magistrate subordinate to him at a time  and place to be fixed by the order, and show cause, in the manner hereinafter provided, why the order should not be  made absolute.  (2) No order duly made by a Magistrate under this section shall be called in question in any Civil Court.  Explanation.—A “public place” includes also property belonging to the State, camping grounds and grounds  left unoccupied for sanitary or recreative purposes.  134.  Service  or  notification  of  order.—(1) The  order  shall,  if  practicable,  be  served  on  the  person  against  whom it is made, in the manner herein provided for service of a summons.  (2) If such order cannot be so served, it shall be notified by proclamation, published in such manner as the State  Government may, by rules, direct, and a copy thereof shall be struck up at such place or places as may be fittest for  conveying the information to such person.  135. Person to whom order is addressed to obey or show cause.—The person against whom such order is  made shall—  (a) perform, within the time and in the manner specified in the order, the act directed thereby; or  (b) appear in accordance with such order and show cause against the same.  136.  Consequences  of  his  failing  to  do  so.—If  such  person  does not  perform  such  act  or  appear  and  show  cause, he shall be liable to the penalty prescribed in that behalf in section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860),  and the order shall be made absolute.   65    137. Procedure where existence of public right is denied.—(1) Where an order is made under section 133 for  the purpose of preventing obstruction, nuisance or danger to the public in the use of any way, river, channel or place,  the Magistrate shall, on the appearance before him of the person against whom the order was made, question him as  to whether he denies the existence of  any public right in respect of the way, river, channel or place, and if he does  so, the Magistrate shall, before proceeding under section 138, inquire into the matter.   (2) If in such inquiry the Magistrate finds that there is any reliable evidence in support of such denial, he shall  stay the proceedings until the matter of the existence of such right has been decided by a competent Court; and, if he  finds that there is no such evidence, he shall proceed as laid down in section 138.  (3) A person who has, on being questioned by the Magistrate under sub-section (1), failed to deny the existence  of  a  public  right  of  the  nature  therein  referred  to,  or  who,  having  made  such  denial,  has  failed  to  adduce  reliable  evidence in support thereof, shall not in the subsequent proceedings be permitted to make any such denial.  138. Procedure where he appears to show cause.—(1) If the person against whom an order under section 133  is  made  appears  and  shows  cause  against  the  order,  the  Magistrate  shall  take  evidence  in  the  matter  as  in  a  summons-case.  (2) If the Magistrate is satisfied that the order, either as originally  made  or subject to such  modification as  he  considers necessary, is reasonable and proper, the order shall be made absolute without modification or, as the case  may be, with such modification.  (3) If the Magistrate is not so satisfied, no further proceedings shall be taken in the case.  139. Power of Magistrate to direct local investigation and examination of an expert.—The Magistrate may,  for the purposes of an inquiry under section 137 or section 138—  (a) direct a local investigation to be made by such person as he thinks fit; or  (b) summon and examine an expert.  140.  Power  of  Magistrate  to  furnish  written  instructions,  etc.—(1) Where  the  Magistrate  directs  a  local  investigation by any person under section 139, the Magistrate may—  (a) furnish such person with such written instructions as may seem necessary for his guidance;  (b) declare  by  whom  the whole  or  any  part  of  the  necessary  expenses  of  the  local  investigation  shall  be  paid.  (2) The report of such person may be read as evidence in the case.  (3) Where  the  Magistrate  summons  and  examines  an  expert  under  section  139,  the  Magistrate  may  direct  by  whom the costs of such summoning and examination shall be paid.  141. Procedure on order being made absolute and consequences of disobedience.—(1) When an order has  been  made  absolute  under  section  136  or  section  138,    the  Magistrate  shall  give  notice  of the  same  to  the  person  against  whom  the  order  was  made,  and  shall  further  require  him  to  perform  the  act  directed  by  the  order  within  a  time to be fixed in the notice, and inform him that, in case of disobedience, he will be liable to the penalty provided  by section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).   (2) If  such  act  is  not  performed  within  the  time  fixed,  the  Magistrate  may  cause  it  to  be  performed,  and  may  recover the costs of performing it, either by the sale of any building, goods or other property removed by his order,  or by the  distress and sale of any other movable property of such person within or without such Magistrate’s local  jurisdiction, and if such other property is without such jurisdiction, the order shall authorise its attachment and sale  when endorsed by the Magistrate within whose local jurisdiction the property to be attached is found.  (3) No suit shall lie in respect of anything done in good faith under this section.   66    142.  Injunction  pending  inquiry.—(1) If  a  Magistrate  making  an order  under  section  133  considers  that  immediate measures should be taken to prevent imminent danger or injury of a serious kind to the public, he may  issue  such  an  injunction  to  the  person  against  whom  the  order  was  made,  as  is  required  to  obviate  or  prevent  such danger or injury pending the determination of the matter.   (2)  In default of such person forthwith obeying such injunction, the Magistrate may himself use, or cause  to be used, such means as he thinks fit to obviate such danger or to prevent such injury.  (3)  No suit shall lie in respect of anything done in good faith by a Magistrate under this section.  143. Magistrate  may prohibit repetition or continuance of public nuisance.—A  District Magistrate or  Sub-divisional  Magistrate,  or  any  other  Executive  Magistrate  empowered  by  the  State  Government  or  the  District Magistrate in this behalf, may order any person not to repeat or continue a public nuisance, as defined  in the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), or any special or local law.    C.—Urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger  144. Power to issue order in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger.—(1) In cases where, in  the  opinion  of  a  District  Magistrate,  a  Sub-divisional  Magistrate  or  any  other  Executive  Magistrate  specially  empowered  by the State Government in this behalf, there is sufficient ground for proceeding under this section  and immediate prevention  or speedy remedy is desirable, such Magistrate may, by a  written order stating the  material facts of the case and served in the manner provided by section 134, direct any person to abstain from a  certain act or to take certain order with respect to certain property in his possession or under his management,  if such Magistrate considers that such direction is likely to prevent, or tends to prevent, obstruction, annoyance  or  injury  to  any  person  lawfully  employed,  or  danger  to  human  life,  health  or  safety  or  a  disturbance  of  the  public tranquillity, or a riot, or an affray.   (2) An  order  under  this  section  may,  in  cases  of  emergency  or  in  cases  where  the  circumstances  do  not  admit of the serving in due time of a notice upon the person against  whom the order is directed, be passed ex  parte.  (3) An  order  under  this  section  may  be  directed  to  a  particular  individual,  or  to  persons  residing  in  a  particular place or area, or to the public generally when frequenting or visiting a particular place or area.   (4) No order under this section shall remain in force for more than two months from the making thereof:  Provided that, if the State Government considers it necessary so to do for preventing danger to human life,  health  or  safety  or  for  preventing  a  riot  or  any  affray,  it  may,  by  notification,  direct  that  an  order  made  by  a  Magistrate  under  this  section  shall  remain  in  force  for  such  further  period  not  exceeding  six  months  from  the  date on  which  the  order  made  by  the  Magistrate  would  have, but  for  such order,  expired, as  it  may  specify  in  the said notification.  (5) Any  Magistrate  may,  either on  his own  motion or  on  the  application of  any  person  aggrieved, rescind  or  alter  any  order  made  under  this  section,  by  himself  or  any  Magistrate  subordinate  to  him  or  by  his  predecessor-in-office.  (6) The  State  Government  may,  either  on  its  own  motion  or  on  the  application  of  any  person  aggrieved,  rescind or alter any order made by it under the proviso to sub-section (4).  (7) Where  an  application  under  sub-section (5) or  sub-section (6) is received, the  Magistrate, or  the  State  Government, as the case may be, shall afford to the applicant an early opportunity of appearing before him or  it,  either  in  person  or  by  pleader  and  showing  cause  against  the  order;  and  if  the  Magistrate  or  the  State  Government,  as  the  case  may  be,  rejects  the  application  wholly  or  in  part,  he  or  it  shall  record  in  writing  the  reasons for so doing.   67    D.—Disputes as to immovable property  145. Procedure where dispute concerning land or water is likely to cause breach of peace.— (1) Whenever  an  Executive  Magistrate  is  satisfied  from  a  report  of  a  police  officer  or  upon  other  information that a dispute likely to cause a breach of the peace exists concerning any land or water or  the  boundaries  thereof,  within  his  local  jurisdiction,  he  shall  make  an  order  in  writing,  stating  the  grounds  of  his  being  so  satisfied,  and  requiring  the  parties  concerned  in  such  dispute  to  attend  his  Court in person or by pleader, on a specified date and time, and to put in written statements of their  respective claims as respects the fact of actual possession of the subject of dispute.  (2) For  the  purposes  of  this  section,  the  expression  \"land  or  water\"  includes  buildings,  markets,  fisheries, crops or other produce of land, and the rents or profits of any such property.  (3) A copy of the order shall be served in the manner provided by this Code for the service of a  summons  upon  such  person  or  persons  as  the  Magistrate  may  direct,  and  at  least  one  copy  shall  be  published by being affixed to some conspicuous place at or near the subject of dispute.  (4) The Magistrate  shall  then, without reference to the merits or the claims of any of the parties  to a right to possess the subject of dispute, persue the statements  so  put in,  hear the parties,  receive  all  such  evidence  as  may  be  produced  by  them,  take  such  further  evidence,  if  any,  as  he  thinks   necessary, and, if possible, decide whether any and which of the parties was, at the date of the order  made by him under sub-section (1), in possession of the subject of dispute:  Provided  that  if  it  appears  to  the  Magistrate  that  any  party  has  been  forcibly  and  wrongfully  dispossessed within two months next before the date on which the report of a police officer or other  information was received by the Magistrate, or after that date and before the date of his order under  sub-section (1), he may treat the party so dispossessed as if that party had been in possession on the  date of his order under sub-section (1).  (5) Nothing  in  this  section  shall  preclude  any  party  so  required  to  attend,  or  any  other  person  interested, from showing that no such dispute as aforesaid exists or has existed; and in such case the  Magistrate shall cancel his said order, and all further proceedings thereon shall be stayed, but, subject  to such cancellation, the order of the Magistrate under sub-section (1) shall be final.  (6) (a) If the Magistrate  decides that  one  of the parties  was,  or  should  under the  proviso to sub- section (4) be  treated  as  being,  in  such  possession  of  the  said  subject,  he  shall  issue  an  order  declaring such party to be entitled to possession thereof until evicted therefrom in due course of law,  and  forbidding  all  disturbance  of  such  possession  until  such  eviction;  and  when  he  proceeds  under  the   proviso   to   sub-section (4),   may   restore   to   possession   the   party   forcibly   and   wrongfully  dispossessed.  (b) The order made under this sub-section shall be served and published in the manner laid down  in sub-section (3).  (7) When   any   party   to   any   such   proceeding   dies,   the   Magistrate   may   cause   the   legal  representative  of  the  deceased  party  to  be  made  a  party  to  the  proceeding  and  shall  thereupon  continue the inquiry, and if any question arises as to who the legal representative of a deceased party  for  the  purposes  of  such  proceeding  is,  all  persons  claiming  to  be  representatives  of  the  deceased  party shall be made parties thereto.  (8) If the Magistrate is of opinion that any crop or other produce of the property, the subject of dispute in a  proceeding  under  this  section  pending  before  him,  is  subject  to  speedy  and  natural  decay,  he  may  make  an  order for the proper custody or sale of such property, and, upon the completion of the inquiry, shall make such  order for the disposal of such property, or the sale-proceeds thereof, as he thinks fit.   68    (9) The Magistrate may, if he thinks fit, at any stage of the proceedings under this section, on the  application  of  either party,  issue  a  summons to  any  witness  directing  him  to  attend  or  to  produce  any  document or thing.  (10) Nothing  in  this  section  shall  be  deemed  to  be  in  derogation  of  powers  of  the  Magistrate  to  proceed under section 107.  146. Power to attach subject of dispute and to appoint receiver.—(1) If the Magistrate at any time  after making the order under sub-section (1) of section 145 considers the case to be one of emergency, or  if he decides that none of the parties was then in such possession as is referred to in section 145, or if he is  unable  to  satisfy  himself  as  to  which  of  them  was  then  in  such  possession  of  the  subject  of  dispute,  he  may attach the subject of dispute until a competent Court has determined the rights of the parties thereto  with regard to the person entitled to the possession thereof:  Provided that such Magistrate may withdraw the attachment at any time if he is satisfied that there is  no longer any likelihood of breach of the peace with regard to the subject of dispute.  (2) When  the  Magistrate  attaches  the  subject  of  dispute,  he  may,  if  no  receiver  in  relation  to  such  subject of dispute has been appointed by any Civil Court, make such arrangements as he considers proper  for looking after the property or if he thinks fit, appoint a receiver thereof, who shall have, subject to the  control of the Magistrate, all the powers of a receiver appointed under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908  (5 of 1908):  Provided  that  in  the  event  of  a  receiver  being  subsequently  appointed  in  relation  to  the  subject  of  dispute by any Civil Court, the Magistrate—  (a) shall order the receiver appointed by him to hand over the possession of the subject of dispute  to the receiver appointed  by the  Civil Court and shall thereafter discharge  the receiver appointed  by  him;  (b) may make such other incidental or consequential orders as may be just.  147. Dispute concerning right of use of land or water.—(1) Whenever an Executive Magistrate is  satisfied  from  the  report  of  a  police  officer  or  upon  other  information,  that  a  dispute  likely  to  cause  a  breach  of  the  peace  exists  regarding  any  alleged  right  of  user  of  any  land  or  water  within  his  local  jurisdiction,  whether  such  right  be  claimed  as  an  easement  or  otherwise,  he  shall    make    an    order  in  writing,    stating    the    grounds    of   his    being  so satisfied  and  requiring  the  parties  concerned  in  such  dispute  to  attend  his  Court  in  person  or  by  pleader  on  a  specified  date  and  time  and  to  put  in  written  statements of their respective claims.  Explanation.—The  expression  \"land  or  water\"  has  the  meaning  given  to  it  in  sub-section (2) of  section 145.  (2) The  Magistrate  shall  then  persue  the  statements  so  put  in,  hear  the  parties,  receive  all  such  evidence as may be produced by them respectively, consider the effect of such evidence, take such further  evidence,  if  any,  as  he  thinks  necessary  and,  if  possible,  decide  whether  such  right  exists;  and  the  provisions of section 145 shall, so far as may be, apply in the case of such inquiry.  (3) If  it  appears  to  such  Magistrate  that  such  rights  exist, he  may  make  an  order  prohibiting  any  interference  with  the  exercise  of  such  right,  including,  in  a  proper  case,  an  order  for  the  removal  of  any  obstruction  in  the  exercise of any such right:   69    Provided  that  no  such  order  shall  be  made  where  the  right  is  exercisable  at  all  times  of  the  year,  unless  such  right has been exercised  within three months next before  the receipt under sub-section (1) of the report of a police  officer  or  other  information  leading  to  the  institution  of  the  inquiry,  or  where  the  right  is  exercisable  only  at  particular seasons or on particular occasions, unless the  right has been exercised during the  last of such seasons or  on the last of such occasions before such receipt.  (4) When  in  any  proceedings  commenced  under  sub-section (1) of  section  145  the  Magistrate  finds  that  the  dispute is as regards an alleged right of user of land or water, he may, after recording his reasons, continue with the  proceedings as if they had been commenced under sub-section (1);  and when in any proceedings commenced under sub-section (1) the magistrate finds that the dispute should be dealt  with  under  section  145,  he  may,  after  recording  his  reasons,  continue  with  the  proceedings  as  if  they  had  been  commenced under sub-section (1) of section 145.  148. Local inquiry.—(1) Whenever a local inquiry is necessary for the purposes of section 145, section 146 or  section  147,  a  District  Magistrate  or  Sub-divisional  Magistrate  may  depute  any  Magistrate  subordinate  to  him  to  make the inquiry, and may furnish him with such written instructions as may seem necessary for his guidance, and  may declare by whom the whole or any part of the necessary expenses of the inquiry shall be paid.  (2) The report of the person so deputed may be read as evidence in the case.  (3) When any costs have been incurred by any party to a proceeding under section 145, section 146 or section  147, the Magistrate passing a decision may direct by whom such costs shall be paid, whether by such party or by any  other  party  to  the  proceeding,  and  whether  in  whole  or  in  part  or  proportion  and  such  costs  may  include  any  expenses incurred in respect of witnesses and of pleaders’ fees, which the Court may consider reasonable.  CHAPTER XI  PREVENTIVE ACTION OF THE POLICE  149. Police to prevent cognizable offences.—Every police officer may interpose for the purpose of preventing,  and shall, to the best of his ability, prevent, the commission of any cognizable offence.  150. Information of design to commit cognizable offences.—Every police officer receiving information of a  design  to  commit  any  cognizable  offence  shall  communicate  such  information  to  the  police  officer  to  whom  he  is  subordinate, and to any other officer whose duty it is to prevent or take cognizance of the commission of any such  offence.  151. Arrest to prevent the commission of cognizable offences.—(1) A police officer knowing of a design to  commit any cognizable  offence  may arrest,  without orders from a  Magistrate  and  without a  warrant,  the  person  so  designing, if it appears to such officer that the commission of the offence cannot be otherwise prevented.  (2) No  person  arrested  under  sub-section (1) shall  be  detained  in  custody  for  a  period  exceeding  twenty-four  hours from the time of his arrest unless his further detention is required or authorised under any other provisions of  this Code or of any other law for the time being in force.  152. Prevention of injury to public property.—A police officer may of his own authority interpose to prevent  any injury attempted to be committed in his view to any public property, movable or immovable, or the removal or  injury of any public landmark or buoy or other mark used for navigation.  153.  Inspection  of  weights  and  measures.—(1) Any  officer  in  charge  of  a  police  station  may,  without  a  warrant, enter any place within the limits of such station for the purpose of inspecting or searching for any weights  or  measures or instruments for  weighing, used or kept therein,  whenever  he has reason to believe  that there are  in  such place any weights, measures or instruments for weighing which are false.  (2) If he  finds in  such place any  weights,  measures or instruments for  weighing  which are  false,  he  may seize   70    the same, and shall forthwith give information of such seizure to a Magistrate having jurisdiction.  CHAPTER XII  INFORMATION TO THE POLICE AND THEIR POWERS TO INVESTIGATE  154.  Information  in  cognizable  cases.—(1) Every  information  relating  to  the  commission  of  a  cognizable  offence,  if  given  orally  to  an  officer  in  charge  of  a  police  station,  shall  be  reduced  to  writing  by  him  or  under  his  direction,  and  be  read  over  to  the  informant;  and  every  such  information,  whether  given  in  writing  or  reduced  to  writing as aforesaid, shall be signed by the person giving it, and the substance thereof shall be entered in a book to  be kept by such officer in such form as the State Government may prescribe in this behalf:  1 [Provided  that  if  the  information  is  given  by  the  woman  against  whom  an  offence  under  section  326A,              section  326B,  section  354,  section  354A,  section  354B,  section  354C,  section  354D,  section  376,  section  376A,  section  376B,  section  376C,  section 376D,  section  376E  or  section  509  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code (45  of  1860) is  alleged to have been committed or attempted, then such information shall be recorded, by a woman police officer or  any woman officer:  Provided further that—  (a)  in  the  event  that  the  person  against  whom  an  offence  under  section  354,  section  354A,  section  354B,  section 354C, section 354D, section 376, section 376A, section 376B, section 376C, section 376D, section 376E  or  section  509  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code (45  of  1860) is  alleged  to  have  been  committed  or  attempted,  is  temporarily or permanently mentally or physically disabled, then such information shall be recorded by a police  officer, at  the  residence  of the person seeking to report such offence or at a convenient place of such person’s  choice, in the presence of an interpreter or a special educator, as the case may be;  (b) the recording of such information shall be videographed;  (c) the police officer shall get the statement of the person recorded by a Judicial Magistrate under clause (a)  of sub-section (5A) of section 164 as soon as possible.]  (2) A copy of the information as recorded under sub-section (1) shall be given forthwith, free of cost, to the informant.  (3) Any  person  aggrieved  by  a  refusal  on  the  part  of  an  officer  in  charge  of  a  police  station  to  record  the  information referred to in sub-section (1) may send the substance of such information, in writing and by post, to the  Superintendent of Police concerned who, if satisfied that such information discloses the commission of a cognizable  offence,  shall  either  investigate  the  case  himself  or  direct  an  investigation  to  be  made  by  any  police  officer  subordinate to him, in the manner provided by this Code, and such officer shall have all the powers of an officer in  charge of the police station in relation to that offence.  155. Information as to non-cognizable cases and investigation of such cases.—(1) When information is given to  an officer in charge of a police station of the commission within the limits of such station of a non-cognizable offence, he  shall enter or cause to be entered the substance of the information in a book to be kept by such officer in such form as the  State Government may prescribe in this behalf, and refer the informant to the Magistrate.  (2) No police officer shall investigate a non-cognizable case without the order of a Magistrate having power to  try such case or commit the case for trial.  (3) Any  police  officer  receiving such  order  may  exercise  the  same  powers  in  respect  of  the  investigation  (except the power to arrest without warrant) as an officer in charge of a police station may exercise in a cognizable  case.  (4) Where a case relates to two or more offences of which at least one is cognizable, the case shall be deemed  to be a cognizable case, notwithstanding that the other offences are non-cognizable.  156. Police officer’s power to investigate cognizable case.—(1) Any  officer  in  charge  of  a  police  station  may,  without the order of a Magistrate,  investigate any cognizable  case  which a  Court  having jurisdiction over the local area  within the limits of such station would have power to inquire into or try under the provisions of Chapter XIII.  (2) No proceeding of a  police  officer in any  such case  shall at  any stage  be  called in question on the  ground  that the case was one which such officer was not empowered under this section to investigate.  (3) Any Magistrate empowered under section 190 may order such an investigation as above-mentioned.                                                    1. Ins. by Act 13 of 2013, s. 13 (w.e.f. 3-2-2013).    71    157.  Procedure  for  investigation.—(1) If,  from  information  received  or  otherwise,  an  officer  in  charge  of  a  police  station  has  reason  to  suspect  the  commission  of  an  offence  which  he  is  empowered  under  section  156  to  investigate,  he  shall  forthwith  send  a  report  of  the  same  to  a  Magistrate  empowered  to  take  cognizance  of  such  offence  upon  a  police  report and  shall  proceed  in  person, or  shall  depute  one  of  his  subordinate  officers  not  being  below such rank as the  State  Government  may, by  general  or special order, prescribe  in this behalf, to proceed, to  the spot, to investigate the facts and circumstances of the case, and, if necessary, to take measures for the discovery  and arrest of the offender:  Provided that—  (a) when information as  to the commission of any  such offence is  given against any person by  name  and  the case is not of a serious nature, the officer in charge of a police station need not proceed in person or depute a  subordinate officer to make an investigation on the spot;   (b) if it appears to the officer in charge of a police station that there is no sufficient ground for entering on  an investigation, he shall not investigate the case.  1 [Provided  further  that  in  relation  to  an  offence  of  rape,  the  recording  of  statement  of  the  victim  shall  be  conducted  at  the  residence  of  the  victim  or  in  the  place  of  her  choice  and  as  far  as  practicable  by  a  woman  police  officer in the presence of her parents or guardian or near  relatives or social worker of the locality.]    (2) In each of the cases mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) of the proviso to sub-section (1), the officer in charge  of the police  station shall state  in  his report his reasons for not  fully complying  with the requirements of that  sub- section,  and,  in  the  case  mentioned  in  clause (b) of  the  said  proviso,  the  officer  shall  also  forthwith  notify  to  the  informant, if any, in such manner as may be prescribed by the State Government, the fact that he will not investigate  the case or cause it to be investigated.  158.  Report  how  submitted.—(1) Every  report  sent  to  a  Magistrate  under  section  157  shall,  if  the  State  Government so directs, be submitted through such superior officer of police as the State Government, by general or  special order, appoints in that behalf.  (2) Such superior officer may give such instructions to the officer in charge of the police station as he thinks fit,  and shall, after recording such instructions on such report, transmit the same without delay to the Magistrate.  159.  Power  to  hold  investigation  or  preliminary inquiry.—Such  Magistrate,  on  receiving  such  report,  may  direct an investigation, or, if he thinks fit, at once proceed, or depute any Magistrate subordinate to him to proceed, to  hold a preliminary inquiry into, or otherwise to dispose of, the case in the manner provided in this Code.  160. Police officer’s power to require attendance of witnesses.—(1) Any police officer making an investigation  under this Chapter may, by order in writing, require the attendance before himself of any person being within the limits  of  his own or any adjoining station  who, from  the information  given or otherwise, appears to be acquainted  with  the  facts and circumstances of the case; and such person shall attend as so required:  Provided that no male person  2 [under the age of fifteen years or above the age of sixty-five years or a woman or  a mentally or physically disabled person] shall be required to attend at any place other than the place in which such  male person or woman resides.  (2) The  State Government  may, by rules  made  in this behalf, provide  for the payment by the  police  officer of  the reasonable expenses of every person, attending under sub-section (1) at any place other than his residence.  161. Examination of witnesses by police.—(1) Any police officer making an investigation under this Chapter,  or any police officer not below such rank as the State Government may, by general or special order, prescribe in this  behalf, acting on the requisition of such officer, may examine orally any person supposed to be acquainted with the  facts and circumstances of the case.  (2) Such person shall be bound to answer truly all questions relating to such case put to him by such officer,  other than questions the answers to which would have a tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or to a penalty  or forfeiture.  (3) The  police  officer  may  reduce  into  writing  any  statement  made  to  him  in  the  course  of  an  examination  under this section; and if he does so, he shall make a separate and true record of the statement of each such person  whose statement he records.  3 [Provided that statement made under this sub-section may also be recorded by audio-video electronic means:]                                                    1.

Statements to police not to be signed: Use of statements in evidence.—(1) No statement made by any  person to a police officer in the course of an investigation under this Chapter, shall, if reduced to writing, be signed  by the person making it; nor shall any such statement or any record thereof, whether in a police diary or otherwise,  or any part of such statement or record, be used for any purpose, save as hereinafter provided, at any inquiry or trial  in respect of any offence under investigation at the time when such statement was made:  Provided that  when any witness is called for the prosecution in such inquiry or trial whose statement has been  reduced into writing as aforesaid, any part of his statement, if duly proved, may be used by the accused, and with the  permission of the Court, by the prosecution, to contradict such witness in the manner provided by section 145 of the  Indian Evidence Act , 1872 (1 of 1872); and when any part of such statement is so used, any part thereof may also  be  used in the re-examination of such  witness, but  for the  purpose  only of explaining any  matter referred to in  his  cross-examination.  (2) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to apply to any statement falling within the provisions of clause (1) of  section 32 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872); or to affect the provisions of section 27 of that Act.  Explanation.—An  omission  to  state  a  fact  or  circumstance  in  the  statement  referred  to  in  sub-section (1) may  amount to contradiction if the same appears to be significant and otherwise relevant having regard to the context in  which such omission occurs and whether any omission amounts to a contradiction in the particular context shall be a  question of fact.  163. No inducement to be offered.—(1) No police officer or other person in authority shall offer or make, or  cause  to  be  offered  or  made,  any  such  inducement,  threat  or  promise  as  is  mentioned  in  section  24  of  the  Indian  Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872).  (2) But no police officer or other person shall prevent, by any caution or otherwise, any person from making in  the course of any investigation under this Chapter any statement which he may be disposed to make of his own free  will:  Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall affect the provisions of sub-section (4) of section 164.  164. Recording of confessions and statements.—(1) Any Metropolitan Magistrate or Judicial Magistrate may,  whether or not he has jurisdiction in the  case, record any confession or statement  made  to him in the course  of an  investigation under this Chapter or under any other law for the time being in force, or at any time afterwards before  the commencement of the inquiry or trial:  2 [Provided that  any confession or statement  made  under this sub-section  may also be  recorded by audio-video  electronic means in the presence of the advocate of the person accused of an offence:  Provided  further that no confession shall be recorded by a police officer on whom any power  of a Magistrate  has been conferred under any law for the time being in force.]   (2) The  Magistrate shall, before  recording any such confession, explain to the  person  making it that  he  is  not  bound to make a confession and that, if he does so, it may be used as evidence against him; and the Magistrate shall  not  record any  such  confession  unless,  upon  questioning  the  person  making  it,  he  has  reason  to  believe  that  it  is  being made voluntarily.  (3) If at any time before the confession is recorded, the person appearing before the Magistrate states that he is not  willing to make the confession, the Magistrate shall not authorise the detention of such person in police custody.  (4) Any such confession shall be recorded in the manner provided in section 281 for recording the examination  of  an  accused  person  and  shall  be  signed by  the  person  making  the  confession;  and  the  Magistrate  shall  make  a  memorandum at the foot of such record to the following effect:—  “I have explained to (name) that he is not bound to make a confession and that, if he does so, any confession he  may make may be used as evidence against him and I believe that this confession was voluntarily made. It was taken  in  my  presence  and  hearing,  and  was  read  over  to  the  person  making  it  and  admitted  by  him  to  be  correct,  and  it  contains a full and true account of the statement made by him.  (Signed) A. B.  Magistrate.”                                                    1. Ins. by Act 13 of 2013, s. 15 (w.e.f. 3-2-2013).   2.

Search by police officer.—(1) Whenever an officer in charge of a police station or a police officer making  an  investigation  has  reasonable  grounds  for  believing  that  anything  necessary  for  the  purposes  of  an  investigation  into  any  offence  which  he  is  authorised  to  investigate  may  be  found  in  any  place  within  the  limits  of  the  police  station of which he is in charge, or to which he is attached, and that  such thing cannot in his opinion be otherwise  obtained without undue delay, such officer may, after recording in writing the grounds of his belief and specifying in  such  writing,  so  far  as  possible,  the  thing  for which  search  is  to  be  made,  search,  or  cause  search  to  be  made,  for  such thing in any place within the limits of such station.  (2) A police officer proceeding under sub-section (1), shall, if practicable, conduct the search in person.  (3) If he  is unable to conduct the  search in person, and there  is no other person competent to  make  the  search  present at the time, he may, after recording in writing his reasons for so doing, require any officer subordinate to him  to  make  the  search,  and  he  shall  deliver  to such  subordinate  officer  an  order  in  writing,  specifying  the  place  to  be  searched,  and  so  far  as  possible,  the  thing  for  which  search  is  to  be  made;  and  such  subordinate  officer  may  thereupon search for such thing in such place.  (4) The  provisions  of  this Code  as  to  search-warrants  and  the  general  provisions  as  to  searches  contained  in  section 100 shall, so far as may be, apply to a search made under this section.  (5) Copies  of  any  record  made  under  sub-section (1) or  sub-section (3) shall  forthwith  be  sent to  the  nearest  Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence, and the owner or occupier of the place searched shall, on  application, be furnished, free of cost, with a copy of the same by the Magistrate.  166. When officer in charge of police station may require another to issue search-warrant.—(1) An officer  in  charge  of  a  police  station  or  a  police  officer  not  being  below  the  rank  of  sub-inspector  making  an  investigation  may  require  an  officer  in  charge  of  another  police  station,  whether  in  the  same  or  a  different  district,  to  cause  a  search to be made in any place, in any case in which the former officer might cause such search to be made, within  the limits of his own station.  (2) Such  officer,  on  being  so  required,  shall  proceed  according  to  the provisions  of  section  165,  and  shall  forward the thing found, if any, to the officer at whose request the search was made.   (3) Whenever there is reason to believe that the delay  occasioned by requiring  an officer in charge of another  police station to cause a  search to be  made  under sub-section (1) might result in evidence of the commission of an  offence being concealed or destroyed, it shall be lawful for an officer in charge of a police station or a police officer  making any  investigation under this  Chapter to search, or cause to be searched, any  place in the limits of another  police  station  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  section  165,  as  if  such  place  were  within  the  limits  of  his  own  police station.  (4) Any officer conducting a search under sub-section (3) shall forthwith send notice of the search to the officer  in charge of the police station within the limits of which such place is situate, and shall also send with such notice a  copy of the list (if any) prepared under section 100, and shall also send to the nearest Magistrate empowered to take  cognizance of the offence, copies of the records referred to in sub-sections (1) and (3) of section 165.  (5) The owner or occupier of the place searched shall, on application, be furnished free of cost with a copy of  any record sent to the Magistrate under sub-section (4).  1 [166A.

(2) All  the  evidence  taken  or  collected  under  sub-section (1),  or  authenticated  copies  thereof  or  the  thing  so  collected, shall be forwarded by the Magistrate or police officer, as the case may be, to the Central Government for  transmission  to  the  Court  or  the  authority  issuing  the  letter  of  request,  in  such  manner  as  the  Central  Government  may deem fit.]  167. Procedure when  investigation cannot be completed in twenty-four hours.—(1) Whenever any person  is arrested and detained in custody, and it appears that the  investigation cannot be   completed within the  period of  twenty-four hours fixed by section 57, and there are grounds for believing that the accusation or information is well- founded, the officer in charge of the police station or the  police officer making the  investigation, if he is not below  the rank of sub-inspector, shall forthwith transmit to the nearest Judicial Magistrate a copy of the entries in the diary  hereinafter  prescribed  relating to the case, and  shall at the same time forward the accused to such Magistrate.   (2) The Magistrate to whom an accused person is forwarded under this section may, whether he has or has not  jurisdiction  to  try  the  case,  from  time  to  time,  authorise  the  detention  of  the  accused  in  such  custody  as  such  Magistrate thinks fit, for a term not exceeding fifteen days in the whole; and if he has no jurisdiction to try the case  or  commit  it  for  trial,  and  considers  further  detention  unnecessary,  he  may  order  the  accused  to  be  forwarded  to  a  Magistrate having such jurisdiction:   Provided that—   1 [(a) the  Magistrate  may  authorise the detention  of  the  accused  person,  otherwise  than  in  custody  of  the  police,  beyond  the  period  of  fifteen  days,  if  he  is  satisfied  that  adequate  grounds  exist  for  doing  so,  but  no  Magistrate shall authorise the detention of the accused person in custody under this paragraph for a total period  exceeding—   (i) ninety days, where the investigation relates to an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or  imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years;  (ii) sixty days, where the investigation relates to any other offence,  and, on the expiry of the  said period of ninety days, or sixty days, as the case  may be, the accused person shall be  released on bail if he is prepared to and does furnish bail, and every person released on bail under this sub-section  shall be deemed to be so released under the provisions of Chapter XXXIII for the purposes of that Chapter;]  2 [(b)  no  Magistrate  shall  authorise  detention  of  the  accused  in  custody  of  the  police  under  this  section  unless  the  accused  is  produced  before  him  in  person  for  the  first  time  and  subsequently  every  time  till  the  accused remains in the custody of the police, but the Magistrate may extend further detention in judicial custody  on production of the accused either in person or through the medium of electronic video linkage;]   (c) no  Magistrate  of  the  second  class,  not  specially  empowered  in  this  behalf  by  the  High  Court,  shall  authorise detention in the custody of the police.  3 [Explanation  I.—For  the  avoidance  of  doubts,  it  is  hereby  declared  that,  notwithstanding  the  expiry  of  the  period specified in paragraph (a), the accused shall be detained in custody so long as he does not furnish bail.]  4 [Explanation  II.—If  any  question  arises  whether  an  accused  person  was  produced  before  the  Magistrate  as  required  under  clause  (b),  the  production  of  the  accused  person  may  be  proved  by  his  signature  on  the  order  authorising detention or by the order certified by the Magistrate as to production of the accused person through the  medium of electronic video linkage, as the case may be.]                                                    1.

Release of accused when evidence deficient.—If, upon an  investigation under this Chapter, it  appears to  the officer in charge of the police station that there is  not sufficient evidence or reasonable ground of suspicion to  justify the forwarding of the accused to a Magistrate, such officer shall, if such person is in custody, release him on  his executing a bond, with or without sureties, as such officer may direct, to appear, if and when so required, before  a Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence on a police report, and to try the accused or commit him  for trial.  170.  Cases  to  be  sent  to  Magistrate,  when  evidence  is  sufficient.—(1) If,  upon  an  investigation  under  this  Chapter, it appears to the officer in charge of the police station that there is sufficient evidence or reasonable ground   as  aforesaid, such  officer  shall  forward  the accused under custody to a Magistrate empowered to take cognizance  of the offence upon a police report and to try the accused or commit him for trial, or, if the offence is bailable and  the accused is able to give security, shall take security from him for his appearance before such Magistrate on a day  fixed and for his attendance from day to day before such Magistrate until otherwise directed.                                                    1.

(7) The provisions of this section apply to the abetment of, or attempt to commit, an offence as they apply to the  offence.  4 [198A.

(5) No  Court  of  Session  shall  take  cognizance  of  an  offence  under  sub-section (2) unless  the  complaint  is  made  within  six  months  from  the  date  on  which  the  offence  is  alleged  to  have  been  committed.  (6) Nothing in this section shall affect the right of the person against whom the offence is alleged to  have  been  committed,  to  make  a  complaint  in  respect  of  that  offence  before  a  Magistrate  having  jurisdiction or the power of such Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence upon such complaint.  CHAPTER XV  COMPLAINTS TO MAGISTRATES  200.  Examination  of  complainant.—A  Magistrate  taking  cognizance  of  an  offence  on  complaint  shall  examine  upon  oath  the  complainant  and  the  witnesses  present,  if  any,  and  the  substance  of  such  examination  shall  be  reduced  to  writing  and  shall  be  signed  by  the  complainant  and  the  witnesses,  and  also by the Magistrate:  Provided  that,  when  the  complaint  is  made  in  writing,  the  Magistrate  need  not  examine  the  complainant and the witnesses—  (a) if a public servant acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duties or a Court  has made the complaint; or  (b) if  the  Magistrate  makes  over  the  case  for  inquiry  or  trial  to  another  Magistrate  under                  section 192:  Provided  further that  if the  Magistrate  makes  over  the  case  to  another Magistrate  under  section  192  after examining the complainant and the witnesses, the latter Magistrate need not re-examine them.  201. Procedure by Magistrate not competent to take cognizance of the case.—If the complaint is  made to a Magistrate who is not competent to take cognizance of the offence, he shall,—  (a) if  the  complaint  is  in  writing,  return  it  for  presentation  to  the  proper  Court  with  an  endorsement to that effect;  (b) if the complaint is not in writing, direct the complainant to the proper Court.  202. Postponement of issue of process.—(1) Any Magistrate, on receipt of a complaint of an offence  of which he is authorised to take cognizance or which has been made over to him under section 192, may,  if he thinks fit,  1 [and shall, in a case where the accused is residing at a place beyond the area in which he  exercises  his  jurisdiction,] postpone  the  issue  of  process  against  the  accused,  and  either inquire  into the  case himself or direct an investigation to be made by a police officer or by such other person as he thinks  fit, for the purpose of deciding whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding:                                                    1. Ins. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 19 (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).   88    Provided that no such direction for investigation shall be made,—    (a) where it appears to the Magistrate that the offence complained of is triable exclusively by the  Court of Session; or   (b) where the complaint has not been made by a Court, unless the complainant and the witnesses  present (if any) have been examined on oath under section 200.  (2) In an inquiry under sub-section (1), the Magistrate may, if he thinks fit, take evidence of witnesses  on oath:  Provided  that if it appears  to the  Magistrate  that the  offence complained  of is  triable  exclusively by  the Court of Session, he shall call upon the complainant to produce all his witnesses and examine them on  oath.  (3) If an  investigation under sub-section (1) is  made by a  person  not being a  police  officer, he  shall  have for that investigation all the powers conferred by this Code on an officer in charge of a police station  except the power to arrest without warrant.  203.   Dismissal   of   complaint.—If,   after   considering   the   statements   on   oath   (if   any)   of   the  complainant and of the witnesses and the result of the inquiry or investigation (if any) under section 202,  the  Magistrate  is  of  opinion  that  there  is  no  sufficient  ground  for  proceeding,  he  shall  dismiss  the  complaint, and in every such case he shall briefly record his reasons for so doing.  CHAPTER XVI  COMMENCEMENT OF PROCEEDINGS BEFORE MAGISTRATES  204. Issue of process.—(1) If in the opinion of a Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence there is  sufficient ground for proceeding, and the case appears to be—  (a) a summons-case, he shall issue his summons for the attendance of the accused, or  (b) a warrant-case, he may issue a warrant, or, if he thinks fit, a summons, for causing the accused  to  be  brought  or  to  appear  at  a  certain  time  before  such  Magistrate  or  (if  he  has  no  jurisdiction  himself) some other Magistrate having jurisdiction.  (2) No summons or warrant shall be issued against the accused under sub-section (1) until a list of the  prosecution witnesses has been filed.  (3) In  a  proceeding  instituted  upon  a  complaint  made  in  writing,  every  summons  or  warrant  issued  under sub-section (1) shall be accompanied by a copy of such complaint.  (4) When by any law for the time being in force any process-fees or other fees are payable, no process  shall  be  issued  until  the  fees  are  paid  and,  if  such  fees  are  not  paid  within  a  reasonable  time,  the  Magistrate may dismiss the complaint.  (5) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the provisions of section 87.  205. Magistrate may dispense with personal attendance of accused.—(1) Whenever a Magistrate  issues  a  summons,  he  may,  if he  sees  reason  so  to  do,  dispense  with  the  personal  attendance  of  the  accused and permit him to appear by his pleader.   (2) But  the  Magistrate  inquiring  into  or  trying  the  case  may,  in  his  discretion,  at  any  stage  of  the  proceedings,  direct the personal attendance of the  accused, and, if necessary, enforce such  attendance in  the manner hereinbefore provided.   89    206. Special summons in cases of petty offence.—(1) If, in the opinion of a Magistrate taking cognizance of a  petty  offence,  the  case  may  be  summarily disposed  of  under  section  260  1 [or  section  261],  the  Magistrate  shall,  except  where  he  is,  for  reasons  to  be  recorded  in  writing  of  a  contrary  opinion,  issue  summons  to  the  accused  requiring  him either to appear in person or by pleader before  the  Magistrate  on a  specified date, or if he  desires to  plead guilty to the charge without appearing before the Magistrate, to transmit before the specified date, by post or  by  messenger  to  the  Magistrate,  the  said  plea  in  writing  and  the  amount  of  fine  specified  in  the  summons  or  if  he  desires  to  appear  by  pleader  and  to  plead  guilty  to  the  charge  through  such  pleader,  to  authorise,  in  writing,  the  pleader to plead guilty to the charge on his behalf and to pay the fine through such pleader:  Provided that the amount of the fine specified in such summons shall not exceed  2 [one thousand rupees].  (2) For  the  purposes  of  this  section, “petty  offence” means  any  offence  punishable  only  with  fine  not  exceeding one thousand rupees, but does not include any offence so punishable under the Motor Vehicles Act,  1939 (4 of 1939) 3 , or under any other law which provides for convicting the accused person in his absence on a  plea of guilty.  4 [(3) The State Government may, by notification, specially empower any Magistrate to exercise the powers  conferred  by  sub-section (1) in  relation  to  any  offence  which  is  compoundable  under  section  320  or  any  offence punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or with fine, or with both where  the  Magistrate  is  of  opinion  that,  having  regard  to  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  case,  the  imposition  of  fine only would meet the ends of justice.]  207.  Supply  to  the  accused  of  copy  of  police  report  and  other  documents.—In  any  case  where  the  proceeding  has  been  instituted  on  a  police  report,  the  Magistrate  shall  without  delay  furnish  to  the  accused,  free of cost, a copy of each of the following:—  (i) the police report;  (ii) the first information report recorded under section 154;  (iii) the statements recorded under sub-section (3) of section 161 of all persons whom the prosecution  proposes  to  examine  as  its  witnesses,  excluding  therefrom  any  part  in  regard  to  which  a  request  for  such  exclusion has been made by the police officer under sub-section (6) of section 173;  (iv) the confessions and statements, if any, recorded under section 164;  (v) any  other  document  or  relevant  extract  thereof  forwarded  to  the  Magistrate  with  the  police  report  under sub-section (5) of section 173:  Provided  that  the  Magistrate  may,  after  perusing  any  such  part  of a  statement  as  is  referred  to  in             clause   (iii) and  considering  the  reasons  given  by  the  police  officer  for  the  request,  direct  that  a  copy  of  that  part  of  the  statement  or  of  such  portion  thereof  as  the  Magistrate  thinks  proper,  shall  be  furnished  to  the  accused:  Provided  further  that  if  the  Magistrate  is  satisfied  that  any  document  referred  to  in  clause (v) is  voluminous, he shall, instead of furnishing the accused with a copy thereof, direct that he will only be allowed  to inspect it either personally or through pleader in Court.  208.  Supply  of  copies  of  statements  and  documents  to  accused  in  other  cases  triable  by  Court  of  Session.—Where,  in  a  case  instituted  otherwise  than  on  a  police  report,  it  appears  to  the  Magistrate  issuing  process  under section  204  that  the  offence  is  triable  exclusively  by  the  Court  of  Session,  the  Magistrate  shall  without delay furnish to the accused, free of cost, a copy of each of the following:—  (i) the  statements  recorded  under  section  200  or  section  202,  of  all  persons  examined  by  the  Magistrate;                                                    1. Ins. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 20 (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).  2. Subs. by s. 20, ibid., for “one hundred rupees” (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).  3. Now the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (59 of 1988).   4. Ins. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 18 (w.e.f. 18-12-1978).    90    (ii) the statements and confessions, if any, recorded under section 161 or section 164;  (iii) any  documents  produced  before  the  Magistrate  on  which  the  prosecution  proposes  to  rely:  Provided that if the Magistrate is satisfied that any such document is voluminous, he shall, instead  of  furnishing  the  accused  with  a  copy  thereof,  direct  that  he  will  only  be  allowed  to  inspect  it  either  personally or through pleader in Court.  209. Commitment of case to Court of Session when offence is triable exclusively by it.—When in  a case instituted on a police report or otherwise, the accused appears or is brought before the Magistrate  and it appears to the Magistrate that the offence is triable exclusively by the Court of Session, he shall—  1 [(a) commit, after complying with the provisions of section 207 or section 208, as the case may  be, the case to the Court of Session, and subject to the provisions of this Code relating to bail, remand  the accused to custody until such commitment has been made;]  (b) subject to the provisions of this Code relating to bail, remand the accused to custody during,  and until the conclusion of, the trial;  (c) send to that Court the record of the case and the documents and articles, if any, which are to  be produced in evidence;  (d) notify the Public Prosecutor of the commitment of the case to the Court of Session.  210. Procedure to be followed when there is a complaint case and police investigation in respect  of  the  same  offence.—(1) When  in  a  case  instituted  otherwise  than  on  a  police  report  (hereinafter  referred to as a complaint case), it is made to appear to the Magistrate, during the course of the inquiry or  trial held by him, that an investigation by the police is in progress in relation to the offence which is the  subject-matter of the inquiry or trial held by him, the Magistrate shall stay the proceedings of such inquiry  or trial and call for a report on the matter from the police officer conducting the investigation.  (2) If  a  report  is  made  by  the  investigating  police  officer  under  section  173  and  on  such  report  cognizance  of  any  offence  is  taken  by  the  Magistrate  against  any  person  who  is  an  accused  in  the  complaint case, the Magistrate shall inquire into or try together the complaint case and the case arising out  of the police report as if both the cases were instituted on a police report.  (3) If the police report does not relate to any accused in the complaint case or if the Magistrate does  not take cognizance of any offence on the police report, he shall proceed with the inquiry or trial, which  was stayed by him, in accordance with the provisions of this Code.  CHAPTER XVII  THE CHARGE  A.—Form of charges  211. Contents  of charge.—(1) Every charge  under this  Code shall state the  offence  with which  the  accused is charged.   (2) If the law which creates the offence gives it any specific name, the offence may be described in  the charge by that name only.  (3) If the law which creates the offence does not give it any specific name, so much of the definition  of the offence must be stated as to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged.  (4) The law and section of the law against which the offence is said to have been committed shall be  mentioned in the charge.                                                    1. Subs. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 19, for cl. (a)  (w.e.f. 18.12.1978).   91    (5) The  fact  that  the  charge  is  made is  equivalent  to  a  statement  that  every  legal  condition  required  by  law  to  constitute the offence charged was fulfilled in the particular case.  (6) The charge shall be written in the language of the Court.  (7) If  the  accused,  having  been  previously  convicted  of  any  offence,  is  liable,  by  reason  of  such  previous  conviction,  to  enhanced  punishment,  or  to  punishment  of  a  different  kind,  for  a  subsequent  offence,  and  it  is  intended to prove such previous conviction for the purpose  of affecting the punishment which the Court may think  fit  to  award  for  the  subsequent  offence,  the  fact,  date  and  place  of  the  previous  conviction  shall  be  stated  in  the  charge; and if such statement has been omitted, the Court may add it at any time before sentence is passed.  Illustrations  (a) A is charged with the murder of B. This is equivalent to a statement that A's act fell within the definition of murder  given in sections 299 and 300 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860); that it did not fall within any of the general exceptions  of  the  said  Code;  and  that  it  did  not  fall  within  any  of  the  five  exceptions  to  section  300,  or  that,  if  it  did  fall  within  Exception 1, one or other of the three provisos to that exception applied to it.  (b) A is charged under section 326 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), with voluntarily causing grievous hurt to B  by means of an instrument for shooting. This is equivalent to a statement that the case was not provided for by section 335  of the said Code, and that the general exceptions did not apply to it.  (c) A is accused of murder, cheating, theft, extortion, adultery or criminal intimidation, or using a false property-mark.  The charge  may state that A committed  murder, or cheating, or theft, or extortion, or adultery, or criminal intimidation, or  that he used a false property-mark, without reference to the definitions, of those crimes contained in the Indian Penal Code  (45 of 1860); but the sections under which the offence is punishable must, in each instance  be referred to in the charge.  (d) A  is  charged  under  section  184  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code  (45  of  1860)  with  intentionally  obstructing  a  sale  of  property offered for sale by the lawful authority of a public servant. The charge should be in those words.  212.  Particulars  as  to  time,  place  and  person.—(1) The  charge  shall  contain  such  particulars  as  to  the  time  and place of the alleged offence, and the person (if any) against whom, or the  thing (if any) in respect of which, it  was committed, as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged.  (2) When the accused is charged with criminal breach of trust or dishonest misappropriation of money or other  movable  property,  it  shall  be  sufficient  to  specify  the  gross  sum  or,  as  the  case  may  be,  describe  the  movable  property in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed, and the dates between which the offence  is alleged to have been committed, without specifying particular items or exact dates, and the charge so framed shall  be deemed to be a charge of one offence within the meaning of section 219:  Provided that the time included between the first and last of such dates shall not exceed one year.  213.  When  manner  of  committing  offence  must  be  stated.—When  the  nature  of  the  case  is  such  that  the  particulars mentioned in sections 211 and 212 do not give the accused sufficient notice of the matter with which he  is charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner in which the alleged offence was committed  as will be sufficient for that purpose.  Illustrations  (a) A is accused of the theft of a certain article at a certain time and place. The charge need not set out the manner in  which the theft was effected.  (b) A is accused of cheating B at a given time and place. The charge must set out the manner in which A cheated B.   (c) A  is  accused  of  giving  false  evidence  at  a  given  time  and  place.  The  charge  must  set  out  that  portion  of  the  evidence given by A which is alleged to be false.   92    (d) A is accused of obstructing B, a public servant, in the discharge of his public functions at a given time and place.  The charge must set out the manner in which A obstructed B in the discharge of his functions.  (e) A  is  accused  of  the  murder  of  B  at  a  given  time  and  place.  The  charge  need  not  state  the manner  in  which  A  murdered B.  (f) A is accused of disobeying a direction of the law with intent to save B from punishment. The charge must set out the  disobedience charged and the law infringed.  214.  Words  in  charge  taken  in  sense  of  law  under  which  offence  is  punishable.—In  every  charge  words  used in describing an offence shall be  deemed to have  been used in the  sense  attached to them respectively by  the  law under which such offence is punishable.  215.  Effect  of  errors.— No  error  in  stating  either  the  offence  or  the  particulars  required  to  be  stated  in  the  charge,  and  no  omission  to  state  the  offence  or  those  particulars,  shall  be  regarded  at  any    stage  of  the  case  as  material, unless the accused was in fact misled by such error or omission, and it has occasioned a failure of justice.  Illustrations  (a) A  is  charged  under  section  242  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code  (45  of  1860),  with  \"having  been  in  possession  of  counterfeit  coin,  having  known  at  the  time  when  he  became  possessed  thereof  that such  coin  was  counterfeit,” the  word  \"fraudulently\" being omitted in the charge. Unless it appears that A was in fact misled by this omission, the error shall not  be regarded as material.  (b) A  is  charged  with  cheating  B,  and  the  manner  in  which  he  cheated  B  is  not  set  out  in  the  charge  or  is  set  out  incorrectly. A defends himself, calls witnesses and gives his own account of the transaction. The Court may infer from this  that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating is not material.  (c) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge. There were many  transactions  between  A  and  B,  and  A  had  no  means  of  knowing  to  which  of  them  the  charge  referred,  and  offered  no  defence.  The  Court  may  infer  from  such  facts  that  the  omission to  set  out  the  manner  of  the  cheating  was,  in  the  case,  a  material error.  (d) A is charged with the murder of Khoda Baksh on the 21st January, 1882. In fact, the murdered person's name was  Haidar Baksh, and the date of the murder was the 20th January, 1882. A was never charged with any  murder but one, and  had  heard the  inquiry  before  the  Magistrate,  which  referred  exclusively  to  the  case  of  Haidar  Baksh.  The  Court  may  infer  from these facts that A was not misled, and that the error in the charge was immaterial.  (e) A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January, 1882, and Khoda Baksh (who tried to arrest him  for that murder) on the 21st January, 1882. When charged for the murder of Haidar Baksh, he was  tried for the murder of  Khoda Baksh. The witnesses present in his defence were witnesses in the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer from  this that A was misled, and that the error was material.  216. Court may alter charge.—(1) Any Court may alter or add to any charge at any time before judgment is  pronounced.  (2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and explained to the accused.  (3) If the alteration or addition to a charge is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is not likely, in the  opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused in his defence or the prosecutor in the conduct of the case, the Court  may, in its discretion, after such alteration or addition has been made, proceed with the trial as if the altered or added  charge had been the original charge.  (4) If the alteration or addition is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is likely, in the opinion of the  Court, to prejudice the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid, the Court may either direct a new trial or adjourn the  trial for such period as may be necessary.  (5) If the offence stated in the altered or added charge is one for the prosecution of which previous sanction is  necessary,  the  case  shall  not  be  proceeded  with  until  such  sanction  is  obtained,  unless  sanction  has  been  already  obtained for a prosecution on the same facts as those on which the altered or added charge is founded.   93    217. Recall of witnesses when charge  altered.—Whenever a  charge  is altered or added to by the  Court after  the commencement of the trial, the prosecutor and the accused shall be allowed—  (a) to recall or re-summon, and examine with reference to such alteration or addition, any witness who may  have been examined, unless the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, considers that the prosecutor or the  accused, as the case may be, desires to recall or re-examine such witness for the purpose of vexation or delay or  for defeating the ends of justice;  (b) also to call any further witness whom the Court may think to be material.  B.—Joinder of charges  218.  Separate  charges  for distinct  offences.—(1) For  every  distinct  offence  of  which  any  person  is  accused  there shall be a separate charge, and every such charge shall be tried separately:  Provided that where the accused person, by an application in writing, so desires and the Magistrate is of opinion  that  such  person  is  not  likely  to  be  prejudiced  thereby,  the  Magistrate  may  try  together  all  or  any  number  of  the  charges framed against such person.  (2) Nothing in sub-section (1) shall affect the operation of the provisions of sections 219, 220, 221 and 223.  Illustration  A is accused of a theft on one occasion, and of causing grievous hurt on another occasion. A must be separately charged and  separately tried for the theft and causing grievous hurt.  219. Three offences of same kind within year  may be charged together.—(1) When a person is accused of  more offences than one of the same kind committed within the space of twelve  months from the first to the last of  such offences, whether in respect of the same person or not, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, any  number of them not exceeding three.  (2) Offences  are  of  the  same  kind  when  they  are  punishable  with  the  same  amount  of  punishment  under  the  same section of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) or of any special or local law:  Provided that, for the purposes of this section, an offence punishable under section 379 of the Indian Penal Code  (45 of 1860) shall be  deemed to be an offence of the  same kind as an offence punishable  under section 380 of the  said Code, and that an offence punishable under any section of the said Code, or of any special or local law, shall be  deemed to be an offence of the same kind as an attempt to commit such offence, when such an attempt is an offence.  220. Trial for more than one offence.—(1) If, in one series of acts so connected together as to form the same  transaction, more offences than one are committed by the same person, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial  for, every such offence.  (2) When a person charged with one or more offences of criminal breach of trust or dishonest misappropriation  of  property  as  provided  in  sub-section (2) of  section  212  or  in  sub-section (1) of  section  219,  is  accused  of  committing,  for  the  purpose  of  facilitating  or  concealing  the  commission  of  that offence  or  those  offences,  one  or  more offences of falsification of accounts, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, every such offence.  (3) If the acts alleged constitute an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law in force  for the time being by which offences are defined or punished, the person accused of them may be charged with, and  tried at one trial for, each of such offences.  (4) If several acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves constitute an offence, constitute  when combined a  different offence, the  person accused of them  may be  charged  with, and tried at one  trial for the  offence constituted by such acts when combined, and for any offence constituted by any one, or more, of such acts.  (5) Nothing contained in this section shall affect section 71 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).   94    Illustrations to sub-section (1)  (a) A rescues B, a person in lawful custody, and in so doing causes grievous hurt to C, a constable in whose custody B  was. A may be charged with, and convicted of, offences under sections 225 and 333 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).  (b) A commits house-breaking by day  with intent to commit adultery, and commits, in the house so entered, adultery  with B's wife. A may be separately charged with, and convicted of, offences under sections 454 and 497 of the Indian Penal  Code (45 of 1860).  (c) A  entices  B,  the  wife  of  C,  away  from  C,  with  intent  to  commit  adultery  with  B,  and  then  commits  adultery  with  her. A may be separately charged with, and convicted of, offences under sections 498 and 497 of the Indian Penal Code (45  of 1860).  (d) A has in his possession several seals, knowing them to be counterfeit and intending to use them for the purpose of  committing  several  forgeries  punishable  under  section  466  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code  (45  of  1860).  A  may  be  separately  charged with, and convicted of, the possession of each seal under section 473 of the Indian Penal Code.  (e) With  intent  to  cause  injury  to  B,  A  institutes  a  criminal  proceeding  against  him,  knowing  that  there  is  no  just  or  lawful ground for such proceeding, and also falsely accuses B of having committed an offence, knowing that there is no just  or lawful ground for such charge. A may be separately charged with, and convicted of, two offences under section 211 of the  Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).  (f) A, with intent to cause injury to B, falsely accuses him of having committed an offence, knowing that there is no just  or  lawful  ground  for  such  charge.  On  the  trial,  A gives  false  evidence  against  B,  intending  thereby  to  cause  B  to  be  convicted of a capital offence. A may be separately charged with, and convicted of, offences under sections 211 and 194 of  the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).  (g) A,  with six others, commits the offences of rioting, grievous  hurt and assaulting a public servant endeavouring in  the discharge of his duty as such to suppress the riot. A  may be separately charged with, and convicted of, offences under  sections 147, 325 and 152 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).   (h) A threatens B, C and D at the same time with injury to their persons with intent to cause alarm to them. A may be  separately  charged  with,  and  convicted  of,  each  of  the  three  offences  under  section  506  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code  (45 of  1860).  The separate charges referred to in illustrations (a) to (h), respectively, may be tried at the same time.  Illustrations to sub-section (3)  (i) A  wrongfully  strikes  B  with  a  cane.  A  may  be  separately  charged  with, and  convicted of,  offences  under  sections  352 and 323 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).  (j) Several  stolen  sacks  of  corn  are  made  over  to  A  and  B,  who  knew  they  are  stolen  property,  for  the  purpose  of  concealing them. A and B thereupon voluntarily assist each other to conceal the sacks at the bottom of a grain-pit. A and B  may  be  separately  charged  with,  and  convicted  of,  offences  under  sections  411  and  414  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code  (45  of  1860).  (k) A exposes her child with the knowledge that she is thereby likely to cause its death. The child dies in consequence of  such exposure. A may be separately charged with, and convicted of, offences under sections 317 and 304 of the Indian Penal  Code (45 of 1860).  (l) A  dishonestly  uses  a  forged  document  as  genuine  evidence,  in  order  to  convict  B,  a  public  servant,  of  an  offence  under  section  167  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code  (45  of  1860).  A  may  be  separately  charged  with,  and  convicted  of,  offences  under sections 471 (read with section 466) and 196 of that Code.  Illustration to sub-section (4)  (m) A commits robbery on B, and in doing so voluntarily causes  hurt to him. A  may be separately charged  with, and  convicted of, offences under sections 323, 392 and 394 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).  221. Where it is doubtful what offence has been committed.—(1) If a single act or series of acts is of such a  nature that it is doubtful which of several offences the facts which can be proved will constitute, the accused may be  charged with having committed all or any of such offences, and any number of such charges may be tried at once; or  he may be charged in the alternative with having committed some one of the said offences.  (2) If  in  such  a  case  the  accused  is  charged  with  one  offence,  and  it  appears  in  evidence  that  he  committed  a  different offence for which he might have been charged under the provisions of sub-section (1), he may be convicted  of the offence which he is shown to have committed, although he was not charged with it.  Illustrations  (a) A  is  accused  of  an  act  which  may  amount  to  theft,  or receiving  stolen  property,  or  criminal  breach  of  trust  or  cheating.  He  may  be  charged  with  theft,  receiving  stolen  property,  criminal  breach  of  trust  and  cheating,  or  he  may  be  charged with having committed theft, or receiving stolen property, or criminal breach of trust or cheating.   95    (b) In the case mentioned, A is only charged with theft. It appears that he committed the offence of criminal breach of  trust, or that of receiving stolen goods. He may be convicted of criminal breach of trust or of receiving stolen goods (as the  case may be), though he was not charged with such offence.  (c) A states on oath before the Magistrate that he saw B hit C with a club. Before the Sessions Court A states on oath  that  B  never  hit  C.  A  may  be  charged  in  the  alternative  and  convicted  of  intentionally  giving  false  evidence,  although  it  cannot be proved which of these contradictory statements was false.  222.  When  offence  proved  included  in  offence  charged.—(1) When  a  person  is  charged  with  an  offence  consisting  of  several  particulars,  a  combination  of  some  only  of  which  constitutes  a  complete  minor  offence,  and  such combination is proved, but the remaining particulars are not proved, he may be convicted of the minor offence,  though he was not charged with it.  (2) When a person is charged with an offence and facts are proved which reduce it to a minor offence, he may  be convicted of the minor offence, although he is not charged with it.  (3) When  a  person  is  charged  with  an  offence,  he  may  be  convicted  of  an  attempt  to  commit  such  offence  although the attempt is not separately charged.  (4) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorise a conviction of any minor offence where the conditions  requisite for the initiation of proceedings in respect of that minor offence have not been satisfied.   Illustrations  (a) A is charged, under section 407 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), with criminal breach of trust in respect of  property entrusted to him as a carrier. It appears, that he did commit criminal breach of trust under section 406 of that Code  in respect of the property, but that it was not entrusted to him as a carrier. He may be convicted of criminal breach of trust  under the said section 406.  (b) A is charged, under section 325 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), with causing grievous hurt. He proves that  he acted on grave and sudden provocation. He may be convicted under section 335 of that Code.  223.  What  persons  may  be  charged  jointly.—The  following  persons  may  be  charged  and  tried  together,  namely:—  (a) persons accused of the same offence committed in the course of the same transaction;  (b) persons accused of an offence and persons accused of abetment of, or attempt to commit, such offence;  (c) persons  accused  of  more  than  one  offence  of  the  same  kind,  within  the  meaning  of  section  219  committed by them jointly within the period of twelve months;  (d) persons accused of different offences committed in the course of the same transaction;  (e) persons  accused  of  an  offence  which  includes  theft,  extortion,  cheating,  or  criminal  misappropriation,  and  persons  accused  of  receiving  or  retaining,  or  assisting  in  the  disposal  or  concealment  of,  property  possession  of  which  is  alleged  to  have  been  transferred  by  any  such  offence  committed  by  the  first-named  persons, or of abetment of or attempting to commit any such last-named offence;  (f) persons accused of offences under sections 411 and 414 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) or either  of those sections in respect of stolen property the possession of which has been transferred by one offence;  (g) persons  accused  of  any  offence  under  Chapter  XII  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code  (45  of  1860)  relating  to  counterfeit coin and persons accused of any other offence under the said Chapter relating to the same coin, or of  abetment of or attempting to commit any such offence; and the  provisions contained in the  former part of this  Chapter shall, so far as may be, apply to all such charges:  Provided that where a number of persons are charged with separate offences and such persons do not fall within  any  of  the  categories  specified  in  this  section,  the  1 [Magistrate or  Court  of  Session] may,  if  such  persons  by  an  application in  writing, so desire, and  2 [if he or it is  satisfied] that  such persons  would not be  prejudicially affected  thereby, and it is expedient so to do, try all such persons together.                                                    1. Subs. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 21, for “Magistrate” (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).  2. Subs. by s. 21, ibid., for certain words (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).   96    224. Withdrawal of remaining charges on conviction on one of several charges.—When a charge containing  more  heads  than  one  is  framed  against  the  same  person,  and  when  a  conviction  has  been  had  on  one  or more  of  them, the complainant, or the officer conducting the prosecution, may, with the consent of the Court,  withdraw the  remaining  charge  or  charges,  or  the  Court  of  its  own  accord  may  stay  the  inquiry  into,  or  trial  of,  such  charge  or  charges and such withdrawal shall have the effect of an acquittal on such charge or charges, unless the conviction be  set aside, in which case the said Court (subject to the order of the  Court setting aside the conviction) may proceed  with the inquiry into, or trial of, the charge or charges so withdrawn.  CHAPTER XVIII  TRIAL BEFORE A COURT OF SESSION  225. Trial to be conducted by Public Prosecutor.—In every trial before  a  Court of Session, the  prosecution  shall be conducted by a Public Prosecutor.  226. Opening case for prosecution.—When the accused appears or is brought before the Court in pursuance of  a  commitment  of  the  case  under  section  209,  the  prosecutor  shall  open  his  case  by  describing  the  charge  brought  against the accused and stating by what evidence he proposes to prove the guilt of the accused.  227. Discharge.—If, upon consideration of the record of the case and the documents submitted therewith, and  after hearing the submissions of the accused and the prosecution in this behalf, the Judge considers that there is not  sufficient  ground  for  proceeding  against  the  accused,  he  shall  discharge  the  accused  and  record  his  reasons  for  so  doing.  228. Framing of charge.—(1) If, after such consideration and hearing as aforesaid, the Judge is of opinion that  there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence which—   (a) is not exclusively triable by the Court of Session, he  may, frame a charge against the accused and, by  order,  transfer  the  case  for  trial  to  the  Chief  Judicial  Magistrate,  1 [or  any  other  Judicial  Magistrate  of  the  first  class and direct the accused to appear before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, or, as the case may be, the Judicial  Magistrate of the first class, on such date as he deems fit, and thereupon such Magistrate] shall try the offence in  accordance with the procedure for the trial of warrant-cases instituted on a police report;  (b) is exclusively triable by the Court, he shall frame in writing a charge against the accused.  (2) Where  the  Judge  frames  any  charge  under  clause (b) of  sub-section (1), the  charge  shall  be  read  and  explained to the accused and the accused shall be asked whether he pleads guilty of the offence charged or claims to  be tried.  229. Conviction on plea of guilty.—If the accused pleads guilty, the Judge shall record the plea and may, in his  discretion, convict him thereon.  230. Date for prosecution evidence.—If the accused refuses to plead, or does not plead, or claims to be tried or  is  not  convicted  under  section  229,  the  Judge  shall  fix  a  date  for  the  examination  of  witnesses,  and  may,  on  the  application of the prosecution, issue any process for compelling the attendance of any witness or the production of  any document or other thing.  231. Evidence for prosecution.—(1) On the date so fixed, the Judge shall proceed to take all such evidence as  may be produced in support of the prosecution.  (2) The Judge may, in his discretion, permit the cross-examination of any witness to be deferred until any other  witness or witnesses have been examined or recall any witness for further cross-examination.  232.  Acquittal.—If,  after  taking  the  evidence  for  the  prosecution,  examining  the  accused  and  hearing  the  prosecution and the defence on the point, the Judge considers that there is no evidence that the accused committed  the offence, the Judge shall record an order of acquittal.  233.  Entering  upon  defence.—(1) Where  the  accused  is  not  acquitted  under  section  232,  he  shall  be  called  upon to enter on his defence and adduce any evidence he may have in support thereof.                                                    1. Subs. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 22, for certain words (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).   97    (2) If the accused puts in any written statement, the Judge shall file it with the record.  (3) If  the  accused  applies  for  the  issue  of  any  process  for  compelling  the  attendance  of  any  witness  or  the  production  of  any  document  or  thing,  the  Judge  shall  issue  such  process  unless  he  considers,  for  reasons  to  be  recorded, that such application should be refused on the ground that it is made for the purpose of vexation or delay  or for defeating the ends of justice.  234. Arguments.—When the examination of the witnesses (if any) for the defence is complete, the prosecutor  shall sum up his case and the accused or his pleader shall be entitled to reply:  Provided  that  where  any  point  of  law  is  raised  by  the  accused  or  his  pleader,  the  prosecution  may,  with  the  permission of the Judge, make his submissions with regard to such point of law.  235. Judgment of acquittal or conviction.—(1) After hearing arguments and points of law (if any), the Judge  shall give a judgment in the case.  (2) If  the  accused  is  convicted,  the  Judge  shall,  unless  he  proceeds  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of              section 360, hear the accused on the questions of sentence, and then pass sentence on him according to law.  236.  Previous  conviction.—In  a  case  where  a  previous  conviction  is  charged  under  the  provisions  of               sub-section (7) of section 211, and the  accused does  not admit that  he  has been previously convicted as alleged in  the charge, the Judge may, after he has convicted the said accused under section 229 or section 235, take evidence in  respect of the alleged previous conviction, and shall record a finding thereon:  Provided that no such charge shall be read out by the Judge nor shall the accused be asked to plead thereto nor  shall the previous conviction be referred to by the prosecution or in any evidence adduced by it, unless and until the  accused has been convicted under section 229 or section 235.  237.  Procedure  in  cases  instituted  under  section  199(2).—(1) A  Court  of  Session  taking  cognizance  of  an  offence  under  sub-section (2) of  section  199  shall  try  the  case  in  accordance  with  the  procedure  for  the  trial  of  warrant-cases instituted otherwise than on a police report before a Court of Magistrate:  Provided that the person against whom the offence is alleged to have been committed shall, unless the Court of  Session, for reasons to be recorded, otherwise directs, be examined as a witness for the prosecution.  (2) Every trial under this section shall be held in camera if either party thereto so desires or if the Court thinks  fit so to do.  (3) If, in any such case, the Court discharges or acquits all or any of the accused and is of opinion that there was  no  reasonable  cause  for  making  the  accusation  against  them  or  any  of  them,  it  may,  by  its  order  of  discharge  or  acquittal, direct the person against whom the offence was alleged to have been committed (other than the President,  Vice-President or the  Governor of a  State or the  Administrator of a  Union territory) to  show cause  why he should  not pay compensation to such accused or to each or any of such accused, when there are more than one.  (4) The  Court shall record and consider any cause  which  may be  shown by the  person  so directed, and if it is  satisfied that there  was no reasonable cause for making the accusation, it may, for reasons to be recorded, make an  order that  compensation to  such amount  not exceeding one thousand rupees, as  it  may determine, be  paid by such  person to the accused or to each or any of them.  (5) Compensation awarded under sub-section (4) shall be recovered as if it were a fine imposed by a Magistrate.  (6) No person who has been directed to pay compensation under sub-section (4) shall, by reason of such order,  be exempted from any civil or criminal liability in respect of the complaint made under this section:  Provided that any amount paid to an accused person under this section shall be taken into account in awarding  compensation to such person in any subsequent civil suit relating to the same matter.  (7) The person who has been ordered under sub-section (4) to pay compensation may appeal from the order, in  so far as it relates to the payment of compensation, to the High Court.   98     (8) When an order for payment of compensation to an accused person is made, the compensation shall not be  paid  to  him  before  the  period  allowed  for  the  presentation  of  the  appeal  has  elapsed,  or,  if  an  appeal  is  presented,  before the appeal has been decided.  CHAPTER XIX  TRIAL OF WARRANT-CASES BY MAGISTRATES  A.—Cases instituted on a police report  238.  Compliance  with  section  207.—When,  in  any  warrant-case  instituted  on  a  police  report,  the  accused  appears or is brought before a Magistrate at the commencement of the trial, the Magistrate shall satisfy himself that  he has complied with the provisions of section 207.  239. When accused shall be discharged.—If, upon considering the police report and the documents sent with  it  under  section  173  and  making  such  examination,  if  any,  of  the  accused  as  the  Magistrate  thinks  necessary  and  after  giving  the  prosecution  and  the  accused  an  opportunity  of  being  heard, the  Magistrate  considers  the  charge  against the accused to be groundless, he shall discharge the accused, and record his reasons for so doing.  240. Framing of charge.—(1) If, upon such consideration, examination, if any, and hearing, the Magistrate is  of opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence triable under this Chapter,  which such Magistrate is competent to try and which, in his opinion, could be adequately punished by him, he shall  frame in writing a charge against the accused.  (2) The charge shall then be read and explained to the accused, and he shall be asked whether he pleads guilty  of the offence charged or claims to be tried.  241. Conviction on plea of guilty.—If the accused pleads guilty, the Magistrate shall record the plea and may,  in his discretion, convict him thereon.  242. Evidence for prosecution.—(1) If the accused refuses to plead or does not plead, or claims to be tried or  the Magistrate does not convict the accused under section 241, the Magistrate shall fix a date for the examination of  witnesses:  1 [Provided  that  the  Magistrate  shall  supply  in  advance  to  the  accused,  the  statement  of  witnesses  recorded  during investigation by the police.]    (2) The  Magistrate  may,  on  the  application  of  the  prosecution,  issue  a  summons  to  any  of  its  witnesses  directing him to attend or to produce any document or other thing.  (3) On the date so fixed, the Magistrate shall proceed to take all such evidence as may be produced in support of  the prosecution:  Provided  that  the  Magistrate  may  permit  the  cross-examination  of  any  witness  to  be  deferred  until  any  other  witness or witnesses have been examined or recall any witness for further cross-examination.  243. Evidence for defence.—(1) The accused shall then be called upon to enter upon his defence and produce  his evidence; and if the accused puts in any written statement, the Magistrate shall file it with the record.  (2) If  the  accused,  after  he  has  entered  upon  his  defence,  applies  to  the  Magistrate  to  issue  any  process  for  compelling the attendance of any witness for the purpose of examination or cross-examination, or the production of  any document or other thing, the Magistrate shall issue such process unless he considers that such application should  be refused on the ground that it is made for the purpose of vexation or delay or for defeating the ends of justice and  such ground shall be recorded by him in writing:  Provided  that,  when  the  accused  has  cross-examined  or  had  the  opportunity  of  cross-examining  any  witness  before entering on his defence, the attendance of such witness shall not be compelled under this section, unless the  Magistrate is satisfied that it is necessary for the ends of justice.                                                    1.

B.—Cases instituted otherwise than on police report                       244.  Evidence  for  prosecution.—(1) When,  in  any  warrant-case  instituted  otherwise  than  on  a  police  report,  the accused appears or is brought before a Magistrate, the Magistrate shall proceed to hear the prosecution and take  all such evidence as may be produced in support of the prosecution.  (2) The Magistrate may, on the application of the prosecution, issue a summons to any of its witnesses directing  him to attend or to produce any document or other thing.  245. When accused  shall be  discharged.—(1) If,  upon taking all the  evidence referred to in section 244, the  Magistrate  considers,  for  reasons  to  be  recorded,  that  no  case  against  the  accused  has  been  made  out  which,  if  unrebutted, would warrant his conviction, the Magistrate shall discharge him.  (2) Nothing  in  this  section  shall  be  deemed  to  prevent  a  Magistrate  from  discharging  the  accused  at  any  previous stage of the case if, for reasons to be recorded by such Magistrate, he considers the charge to be groundless.  246.  Procedure  where  accused  is  not  discharged.—(1) If,  when  such  evidence  has  been  taken,  or  at  any  previous  stage  of  the  case,  the  Magistrate  is  of  opinion  that  there  is  ground  for  presuming  that  the  accused  has  committed  an  offence  triable  under  this  Chapter,  which  such  Magistrate  is  competent  to  try  and  which,  in  his  opinion, could be adequately punished by him, he shall frame in writing a charge against the accused.  (2) The charge shall then be read and explained to the accused, and he shall be asked whether he pleads guilty  or has any defence to make.  (3) If  the  accused  pleads  guilty,  the  Magistrate  shall  record  the  plea,  and  may,  in  his  discretion,  convict  him  thereon.  (4) If  the  accused  refuses  to  plead,  or  does  not  plead  or  claims  to  be  tried  or  if  the  accused  is  not  convicted  under sub-section (3), he shall be required to state, at the commencement of the  next hearing of the case, or, if the  Magistrate  for  reasons  to  be  recorded  in  writing  so  thinks  fit,  forthwith,  whether  he  wishes  to  cross-examine  any,  and, if so, which, of the witnesses for the prosecution whose evidence has been taken.  (5) If he says he does so wish, the witnesses named by him shall be recalled and, after cross-examination and re- examination (if any), they shall be discharged.  (6) The  evidence  of  any  remaining  witnesses  for  the  prosecution  shall  next be  taken,  and  after  cross- examination and re-examination (if any), they shall also be discharged.  247. Evidence for defence.—The accused shall then be called upon to enter upon his defence and produce his  evidence; and the provisions of section 243 shall apply to the case.  C.—Conclusion of trial  248. Acquittal or  conviction.—(1) If, in any case  under this Chapter in  which a  charge  has been  framed, the  Magistrate finds the accused not guilty, he shall record an order of acquittal.  (2) Where,  in  any  case  under  this  Chapter,  the  Magistrate  finds  the  accused  guilty,  but  does  not  proceed  in  accordance with the provisions of section 325 or section 360, he shall, after hearing the accused on the question of  sentence, pass sentence upon him according to law.  (3) Where,  in  any  case  under  this  Chapter,  a  previous  conviction  is  charged  under  the  provisions  of                  sub-section (7) of section 211 and the accused does not admit that he has been previously convicted as alleged in the  charge, the Magistrate may, after he has convicted the said accused, take evidence in respect of the alleged previous  conviction, and shall record a finding thereon:   100    Provided that no such charge shall be read out by the Magistrate nor shall the accused be asked to plead thereto  nor shall the previous conviction be referred to by the prosecution or in any evidence adduced by it, unless and until  the accused has been convicted under sub-section (2).  249.  Absence  of  complainant.—When  the  proceedings  have  been  instituted  upon  complaint,  and  on  any  day  fixed for the hearing of the case, the complainant is absent, and the offence may be lawfully compounded or is not a  cognizable  offence,  the  Magistrate  may,  in  his  discretion,  notwithstanding  anything  hereinbefore  contained,  at  any  time before the charge has been framed, discharge the accused.  250. Compensation for accusation without reasonable cause.—(1) If, in any case instituted upon complaint  or  upon  information  given  to  a  police  officer  or  to  a  Magistrate,  one  or  more  persons  is  or  are  accused  before  a  Magistrate  of  any  offence  triable  by  a  Magistrate,  and  the  Magistrate  by  whom  the  case  is  heard  discharges  or  acquits all or any of the  accused, and is of opinion  that  there  was  no reasonable  ground  for  making the  accusation  against  them  or any  of  them,  the  Magistrate  may,  by  his  order  of  discharge  or  acquittal,  if  the  person  upon  whose  complaint or information the accusation was made is present, call upon him forthwith to show cause why he should  not pay compensation to such accused or to each or any of such accused when there are more than one; or, if such  person is not present, direct the issue of a summons to him to appear and show cause as aforesaid.  (2) The Magistrate shall record and consider any cause which such complainant or informant may show, and if  he is satisfied that there was no reasonable ground for making the accusation, may, for reasons to be recorded make  an order that compensation to such amount, not exceeding the amount of fine he is empowered to impose, as he may  determine, be paid by such complainant or informant to the accused or to each or any of them.  (3) The Magistrate may, by the order directing payment of the compensation under sub-section (2), further order  that, in default of payment,  the  person ordered to pay such compensation shall undergo simple  imprisonment  for a  period not exceeding thirty days.  (4) When  any  person  is  imprisoned  under  sub-section  (3),  the  provisions  of  sections  68  and  69  of  the  Indian  Penal Code (45 of 1860) shall, so far as may be, apply.  (5) No person who has been directed to pay compensation under this section shall, by reason of such order, be  exempted from any civil or criminal liability in respect of the complaint made or information given by him:  Provided that any amount paid to an accused person under this section shall be taken into account in awarding  compensation to such person in any subsequent civil suit relating to the same matter.  (6) A complainant or informant who has been ordered under sub-section (2) by a Magistrate of the second class  to pay compensation exceeding one hundred rupees, may appeal from the order, as if such complainant or informant  had been convicted on a trial held by such Magistrate.  (7) When  an  order  for  payment  of  compensation  to  an  accused  person  is  made  in  a case  which  is  subject  to  appeal  under  sub-section (6), the  compensation  shall  not  be  paid  to  him  before  the  period  allowed  for  the  presentation of the appeal has elapsed, or, if an appeal is presented, before the appeal has been decided; and where  such  order  is  made  in  a  case  which  is  not  so  subject  to  appeal  the  compensation  shall  not  be  paid  before  the  expiration of one month from the date of the order.  (8) The provisions of this section apply to summons-cases as well as to warrant-cases.  CHAPTER XX  TRIAL OF SUMMONS-CASES BY MAGISTRATES  251.  Substance  of  accusation  to  be  stated.—When  in  a  summons-case  the  accused  appears  or  is  brought  before  the  Magistrate,  the  particulars  of  the  offence  of  which  he  is  accused  shall  be  stated  to  him,  and  he  shall  be  asked whether he pleads guilty or has any defence to make, but it shall not be necessary to frame a formal charge.  252. Conviction on plea of guilty.—If the accused pleads guilty, the Magistrate shall record the plea as nearly  as possible in the words used by the accused and may, in his discretion, convict him thereon.   101    253.  Conviction  on  plea  of  guilty  in  absence  of  accused  in  petty  cases.—(1) Where  a  summons  has  been  issued  under  section  206  and  the  accused  desires  to  plead  guilty  to  the  charge  without  appearing  before  the  Magistrate,  he  shall  transmit  to  the  Magistrate,  by  post  or  by  messenger,  a  letter  containing  his  plea  and  also  the  amount of fine specified in the summons.  (2) The Magistrate may, in his discretion, convict the accused in his absence, on his plea of guilty and sentence  him to pay the fine specified in the summons, and the amount transmitted by the accused shall be adjusted towards  that  fine,  or  where  a  pleader  authorised  by  the  accused  in  this  behalf  pleads  guilty  on  behalf  of  the  accused,  the  Magistrate  shall  record  the  plea  as  nearly  as  possible  in  the  words  used  by  the  pleader  and  may,  in  his  discretion,  convict the accused on such plea and sentence him as aforesaid.  254. Procedure when not convicted.—(1) If the Magistrate does not convict the accused under section 252 or  section 253, the Magistrate shall proceed to hear the prosecution and take all such evidence as may be produced in  support of the prosecution, and also to hear the accused and take all such evidence as he produces in his defence.  (2) The Magistrate may, if he thinks fit, on the application of the prosecution or the accused, issue a summons  to any witness directing him to attend or to produce any document or other thing.  (3) The  Magistrate  may,  before  summoning  any  witness  on such  application  require  that  the  reasonable  expenses of the witness incurred in attending for the purposes of the trial be deposited in Court.  255.  Acquittal or  conviction.—(1) If  the  Magistrate,  upon  taking  the  evidence  referred to  in  section  254  and  such further evidence, if any, as he  may, of his own motion, cause to be produced, finds the accused not guilty, he  shall record an order of acquittal.  (2) Where the Magistrate does not proceed in accordance with the provisions of section 325 or section 360, he  shall, if he finds the accused guilty, pass sentence upon him according to law.  (3) A  Magistrate  may,  under  section  252  or  section  255,  convict  the  accused  of  any  offence  triable  under  this  Chapter, which from the facts admitted or proved he appears to have committed, whatever may be the nature of the  complaint or summons, if the Magistrate is satisfied that the accused would not be prejudiced thereby.  256.  Non-appearance  or  death  of  complainant.—(1) If  the  summons  has  been  issued  on  complaint,  and  on  the  day  appointed  for  the  appearance  of  the  accused,  or  any  day  subsequent  thereto  to  which  the  hearing  may  be  adjourned, the complainant does not appear, the Magistrate shall, notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained,  acquit the accused, unless for some reason he thinks it proper to adjourn the hearing of the case to some other day:  Provided that where the complainant is represented by a pleader or by the officer conducting the prosecution or  where the Magistrate  is of opinion that the personal attendance of the complainant is not necessary, the Magistrate  may, dispense with his attendance and proceed with the case.  (2) The  provisions of sub-section (1) shall, so far as  may be, apply also to cases  where  the  non-appearance of  the complainant is due to his death.  257. Withdrawal of complaint.—If a complainant, at any time before a final order is passed in any case under  this Chapter, satisfies the Magistrate that there are sufficient grounds for permitting him to withdraw his complaint  against the accused, or if there be more than one accused, against all or any of them, the Magistrate may permit him  to withdraw the same, and shall thereupon acquit the accused against whom the complaint is so withdrawn.  258.  Power  to  stop  proceedings  in  certain  cases.—In  any  summons-case  instituted  otherwise  than  upon  complaint,  a  Magistrate  of  the  first  class  or,  with  the  previous  sanction  of  the  Chief  Judicial  Magistrate,  any  other  Judicial Magistrate, may, for reasons to be recorded by him, stop the proceedings at any stage without pronouncing  any judgment and where such stoppage of proceedings is made after the evidence of the principal witnesses has been  recorded, pronounce a judgment of acquittal, and in any other case, release the accused, and such release shall have  the effect of discharge.   102    259.  Power  of  Court  to  convert  summons-cases  into  warrant-cases.—When  in  the  course  of  the  trial  of  a  summons-case  relating to an  offence punishable  with imprisonment for a  term exceeding six  months, it appears to  the  Magistrate  that  in  the  interests  of  justice,  the  offence  should  be  tried  in  accordance  with  the  procedure  for  the  trial of warrant-cases, such Magistrate may proceed to re-hear the case in the manner provided by this Code for the  trial of warrant-cases and may re-call any witness who may have been examined.

(3) Every order submitted for countersigning under sub-section (2) shall be accompanied by a statement of the  facts which, in the opinion of the Magistrate, render the order necessary, and the Chief Judicial Magistrate to whom  it is submitted may, after considering such statement, decline to countersign the order.  268. Power of State Government to exclude certain persons from operation of section 267.—(1) The State  Government may, at any time, having regard to the matters specified in sub-section (2), by general or special order,  direct that any person or class of persons shall not be removed from the prison in which he or they may be confined  or detained, and thereupon, so long as the order remains in force, no order made under section 267, whether before  or after the order of the State Government, shall have effect in respect of such person or class of persons.  (2) Before  making  an  order  under  sub-section (1), the  State  Government  shall  have  regard  to  the  following  matters, namely:—  (a) the  nature  of  the  offence  for  which,  or  the  grounds  on  which,  the  person  or class  of  persons  has  been  ordered to be confined or detained in prison;  (b) the  likelihood  of  the  disturbance  of  public  order  if  the  person  or  class  of  persons  is  allowed  to  be  removed from the prison;  (c) the public interest, generally.  269.

Prisoner  to  be  brought  to  Court  in  custody.—Subject  to  the  provisions  of  section  269,  the  officer  in  charge  of  the  prison  shall,  upon  delivery  of  an  order  made  under  sub-section (1) of  section  267  and  duly  countersigned, where  necessary, under sub-section (2) thereof, cause  the  person named in  the  order to be taken to  the Court in which his attendance is required, so as to be present there at the time mentioned in the order, and shall  cause him to be kept in custody in or near the Court until he has been examined or until the Court authorises him to  be taken back to the prison in which he was confined or detained.  271. Power to issue commission for examination of witness in prison.—The provisions of this Chapter shall  be  without prejudice to the power of the  Court to issue, under section 284, a commission for the examination, as a  witness, of any person confined or detained in a prison; and the provisions of Part B of Chapter XXIII shall apply in  relation  to  the  examination  on  commission  of  any  such  person  in  the  prison  as  they  apply  in  relation  to  the  examination on commission of any other person.

(2) Such memorandum shall be signed by the Magistrate and shall form part of the record.  275. Record in warrant-cases.—(1) In all warrant-cases tried before a Magistrate, the evidence of each witness  shall, as his examination proceeds, be taken down in writing either by the Magistrate himself or by his dictation in  open  Court  or, where  he  is  unable  to  do  so  owing  to  a  physical  or  other  incapacity,  under  his  direction  and  superintendence, by an officer of the Court appointed by him in this behalf:  2 [Provided  that  evidence  of  a  witness  under  this  sub-section  may  also  be  recorded  by  audio-video  electronic  means in the presence of the advocate of the person accused of the offence.]   (2) Where  the  Magistrate  causes the  evidence to he  taken  down,  he  shall record a  certificate  that  the evidence  could not be taken down by himself for the reasons referred to in sub-section (1).                                                    1. Proviso ins. by Act 13 of 2013, s. 20 (w.e.f. 3-2-2013).   2.

(4) The evidence so taken down shall be signed by the Magistrate and shall form part of the record.  276. Record in trial before Court of Session.—(1) In all trials before a Court of Session, the evidence of each  witness shall, as his examination proceeds, be taken down in writing either by the presiding Judge himself or by his  dictation in open Court, or under his direction and superintendence, by an officer of the Court appointed by him in  this behalf.  1 [(2) Such evidence shall ordinarily be  taken down in the  form of a  narrative, but the  presiding Judge  may, in  his discretion, take down, or cause to be taken down, any part of such evidence in the form of question and answer.]  (3) The evidence so taken down shall be signed by the presiding Judge and shall form part of the record.  277.  Language  of  record  of  evidence.—In  every  case  where  evidence  is  taken  down  under  section 275 or  276,—  (a) if the witness gives evidence in the language of the Court, it shall be taken down in that language;  (b)  if  he gives evidence in any other language, it may,  if  practicable, be taken down in that language, and  if    it  is  not  practicable  to  do  so,  a true  translation  of    the  evidence  in  the  language  of  the  Court    shall  be   prepared as  the examination of  the witness  proceeds, signed   by the Magistrate or  presiding Judge, and  shall   form part of   the record;  (c) where under clause (b) evidence is taken down in a language other than the language of the Court, a true  translation  thereof  in  the  language  of  the  Court    shall  be  prepared  as  soon  as  practicable,  signed  by  the  Magistrate or presiding Judge, and shall form part of the record:  Provided that when under clause (b) evidence is taken down in English and a translation thereof in the language  of the Court is not required by any of the parties, the Court may dispense with such translation.  278.  Procedure  in  regard  to  such  evidence  when  completed.—(1) As  the  evidence  of  each  witness  taken  under  section  275  or  section  276  is  completed,  it  shall  be  read  over  to  him  in  the  presence  of  the  accused,  if  in  attendance, or of his pleader, if he appears by pleader, and shall, if necessary, be corrected.  (2) If  the  witness  denies  the  correctness  of  any  part  of  the  evidence  when  the  same  is  read  over  to  him,  the  Magistrate  or  presiding  Judge  may,  instead  of  correcting  the  evidence,  make  a  memorandum  thereon  of  the  objection made to it by the witness and shall add such remarks as he thinks necessary.  (3) If the record of the evidence is in a language different from that in which it has been given and the witness  does not understand that language, the record shall be interpreted to him in the language in which it was given, or in  a language which he understands.  279.  Interpretation  of evidence  to  accused  or  his  pleader.—(1) Whenever  any  evidence  is  given  in a  language not understood by the accused, and he is present in Court in person, it shall be interpreted to him in open  Court in a language understood by him.  (2) If he appears by pleader and the evidence is given in a language other than the language of the  Court, and  not understood by the pleader, it shall be interpreted to such pleader in that language.   (3) When  documents  are  put  for  the  purpose  of  formal  proof,  it  shall  be  in  the discretion  of  the  Court  to  interpret as much thereof as appears necessary.  280.  Remarks  respecting  demeanour  of  witness.—When  a  presiding  Judge  or  Magistrate  has  recorded  the  evidence of a  witness, he shall also record such remarks (if any) as he thinks material respecting the demeanour of  such witness whilst under examination.                                                    1.

Record  of  examination  of  accused.—(1) Whenever  the  accused  is  examined  by  a  Metropolitan  Magistrate, the Magistrate shall make a memorandum of the substance of the examination of the accused in the  language  of  the  Court  and  such  memorandum  shall  be  signed  by  the  Magistrate  and  shall  form  part  of  the  record.  (2) Whenever  the  accused  is  examined  by  any  Magistrate  other  than  a  Metropolitan  Magistrate,  or  by  a  Court  of  Session,  the  whole  of  such  examination,  including    every  question    put    to    him  and  every  answer   given by  him, shall be recorded  in full by the   presiding Judge or Magistrate   himself or  where  he is unable  to do so owing to a physical or other  incapacity, under   his  direction and superintendence by an officer of the  Court appointed by him in this behalf.  (3) The record shall, if practicable, be in the language in which the accused is examined or, if that is not  practicable, in the language of the Court.  (4) The record shall be shown or read to the accused, or, if he does not understand the language in which it  is written, shall be interpreted to him in a language which he understands, and he shall be at liberty to explain  or add to his answers.   (5) It shall thereafter be signed by the accused and by the Magistrate or presiding Judge, who shall certify  under his own hand that the examination was taken in his presence and hearing and that the record contains a  full and true account of the statement made by the accused.  (6) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to apply to the examination of an accused person in the course  of a summary trial.  282.

Record in High Court.—Every High Court may, by general rule, prescribe the manner in which the  evidence of witnesses and the examination of the accused shall be taken down in cases coming before it, and  such evidence and examination shall be taken down in accordance with such rule.  B.—Commissions for the examination of witnesses  284. When  attendance  of witness  may  be dispensed with  and  commission  issued.—(1) Whenever,  in  the course of any  inquiry, trial or other  proceeding under this Code, it appears to a Court or Magistrate that  the examination of a witness  is  necessary  for the ends of  justice, and  that the attendance of  such  witness   cannot  be  procured  without an amount of delay, expense or inconvenience which, under the circumstances of  the case, would be unreasonable, the Court or Magistrate may dispense with such attendance and may issue a  commission for the examination of the witness in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter:  Provided that where the examination of the President or the Vice-President of India or the Governor of a  State or the Administrator of a Union territory as a witness is necessary for the ends of Justice, a commission  shall be issued for the examination of such a witness.  (2) The  Court  may,  when  issuing  a  commission  for    the  examination  of  a  witness  for  the  prosecution,  direct  that  such amount  as  the  Court  considers  reasonable  to  meet  the  expenses  of  the  accused,  including  the  pleader's fees, be paid by the prosecution.  285. Commission to whom to be issued.—(1) If the witness is within the territories to which  this Code  extends,  the  commission  shall  be  directed  to  the  Chief  Metropolitan  Magistrate  or  the  Chief  Judicial  Magistrate, as the case may be, within whose local jurisdiction the witness is to be found.   110    (2) If the witness is in India, but in a State or an area to which this Code does not extend, the commission shall  be directed to such Court or officer as the Central Government may, by notification, specify in this behalf.  (3) If  the  witness  is  in  a  country  or  place  outside  India  and  arrangements  have  been  made  by  the  Central  Government  with  the  Government  of  such  country or  place  for  taking  the  evidence  of  witnesses  in  relation  to  criminal  matters,  the  commission  shall  be  issued  in  such  form,  directed  to  such  Court  or  officer, and  sent  to  such  authority for transmission as the Central Government may, by notification, prescribed in this behalf.  286.  Execution  of  commissions.—Upon  receipt  of  the  commission,  the Chief  Metropolitan  Magistrate,  or  Chief Judicial Magistrate or such Metropolitan or Judicial Magistrate as he may appoint in this behalf, shall summon  the  witness before  him or proceed to the  place  where  the  witness is, and shall take  down his evidence in the  same  manner, and may for this purpose exercise the same powers, as in trials or warrant-cases under this Code.  287.  Parties  may  examine witnesses.—(1) The  parties to  any  proceeding  under  this  Code  in  which  a  commission  is  issued  may  respectively  forward  any  interrogatories  in  writing  which  the  Court  or  Magistrate  directing the commission may think relevant to the issue, and it shall be lawful for the Magistrate, Court or officer to  whom  the  commission,  is  directed,  or  to  whom  the  duty  of  executing  it  is  delegated,  to  examine  the  witness  upon  such interrogatories.  (2) Any  such  party  may  appear  before  such  magistrate,  Court  or  Officer  by  pleader,  or  if  not  in  custody, in  person, and may examine, cross-examine and re-examine (as the case may be) the said witness.  288.  Return  of  commission.—(1) After  any  commission  issued  under  section  284  has  been  duly  executed,  it  shall be returned, together with the deposition of the witness examined thereunder, to the Court or Magistrate issuing  the  commission; and the  commission, the  return thereto and the  deposition shall be  open at  all reasonable  times to  inspection of the parties, and may, subject to all just exceptions, be read in evidence in the case by either party, and  shall form part of the record.  (2) Any deposition  so taken, if it  satisfies the  conditions prescribed by  section 33 of the  Indian Evidence  Act,  1872 (1 of 1872), may also be received in evidence at any subsequent stage of the case before another Court.  289.  Adjournment  of  proceeding.—In  every  case  in  which  a  commission  is  issued  under  section  284,  the  inquiry, trial or other proceeding may be adjourned for a specified time reasonably sufficient for the execution and  return of the commission.  290. Execution of foreign commissions.—(1) The  provisions of section 286 and so  much of section 287 and  section 288 as relate to the execution of a commission and its return shall apply in respect of commissions issued by  any of the  Courts, Judges or Magistrates  hereinafter  mentioned as they apply to commissions issued under section  284.

(2) If  it  appears  that  an  offence  punishable  with  death  or  imprisonment  for  life  has  been  committed  by  some  person or persons unknown, the  High  Court or the  Sessions Judge  may direct that  any  Magistrate  of the  first class  shall hold an inquiry and examine any witnesses who can give evidence concerning the offence and any depositions  so taken may be given in evidence against any person who is subsequently accused of the offence, if the deponent is  dead or incapable of giving evidence or beyond the limits of India.  CHAPTER XXIV   GENERAL PROVISIONS AS TO INQUIRIES AND TRIALS  300. Person once convicted or acquitted not to be tried for same offence.—(1) A person who has once been  tried by a Court of competent jurisdiction for an offence and convicted or acquitted of such offence shall, while such  conviction or acquittal remains in force, not be liable to be tried again for the same offence, nor on the same facts for  any  other  offence  for  which  a  different  charge  from  the  one  made  against  him  might  have  been  made  under                   sub-section (1) of section 221, or for which he might have been convicted under sub-section (2) thereof.  (2) A  person  acquitted  or convicted  of  any  offence  may  be  afterwards  tried,  with  the  consent  of  the  State  Government, for any distinct  offence for which a separate  charge  might have been made against him at the  former  trial under sub-section (1) of section 220.  (3) A person convicted of any offence constituted by any act causing consequences  which, together  with  such  act,  constituted  a  different  offence  from  that  of  which  he  was convicted,  may  be  afterwards  tried  for  such  last  mentioned offence, if the consequences had not happened, or were not known to the Court to have happened, at the  time when he was convicted.  (4) A person acquitted convicted of any offence constituted by any acts may, notwithstanding such acquittal or  conviction,  be  subsequently  charged  with,  and  tried  for,  any  other  offence  constituted  by  the  same  acts  which  he  may have committed if the Court by which he was first tried was not competent to try the offence with which he is  subsequently charged.  (5) A person discharged under section 258 shall not be tried again for the same offence except with the consent  of the Court by which he was discharged or of any other Court to which the first mentioned Court is subordinate.  (6) Nothing   in   this    section   shall   affect   the   provisions   of   section   26   of   the   General    Clauses                                                 Act, 1897 (10 of 1897) or of section 188 of this Code.  Explanation.—The dismissal of a complaint, or the discharge of the accused, is not an acquittal for the purposes  of this section.                                                    1. Ins. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 23 (w.e.f. 18-12-1978).   114    Illustrations   (a)  A  is  tried  upon  a  charge  of  theft  as  a  servant and  aquitted.    He  cannot  afterwards,  while  the  acquittal  remains  in  force, be charged with theft as a servant, or, upon the same facts, with theft simply, or with criminal breach of trust.  (b) A is tried  for causing grievous hurt and convicted.  The person injured afterwards dies.   A  may be tried again  for  culpable homicide.  (c)  A  is  charged  before  the  Court  of  Session  and  convicted  of  the  culpable homicide  of  B.    A  may  not  afterwards  be  tried on the same facts for the murder of B.  (d) A is charged by a Magistrate of the first class with, and convicted by him of, voluntarily causing hurt to B.  A may  not  afterwards  be  tried  for  voluntarily  causing  grievous  hurt  to  B  on  the  same  facts,  unless  the  case  comes  within                        sub-section (3) of this section.  (e) A is charged by a Magistrate of the second class with, and convicted by him of, theft of property from the person of  B. A  may subsequently be charged with, and tried for, robbery on the same facts.    (f) A, B and C are charged by a Magistrate of the first class with, and convicted by him of, robbing D.  A, B and C may  afterwards be charged with, and tried for, dacoity on the same facts.  301. Appearance by Public Prosecutors.—(1) The Public Prosecutor or Assistant Public Prosecutor in charge  of a case may appear and plead without any written authority before any Court in which that case is under inquiry,  trial or appeal.  (2) If in any such case  any private  person instructs a  pleader to prosecute  any person in  any  Court,  the  Public  Prosecutor  or  Assistant  Public  Prosecutor  in  charge  of  the  case  shall  conduct  the  prosecution,  and  the  pleader  so  instructed  shall  act  therein  under  the  directions  of  the  Public  Prosecutor  or  Assistant  Public  Prosecutor,  and  may,  with the permission of the Court, submit written arguments after the evidence is closed in the case.  302. Permission to conduct prosecution.—(1) Any Magistrate inquiring into or trying a  case  may  permit the  prosecution to be conducted by any person other than a police  officer  below the rank  of  inspector;  but  no person,  other  than  the  Advocate-General  or  Government  Advocate  or  a  Public  Prosecutor  or  Assistant  Public  Prosecutor,  shall be entitled to do so without such permission:  Provided  that  no  police  officer  shall  be  permitted  to  conduct  the  prosecution  if  he  has  taken  part  in  the  investigation into the offence with respect to which the accused is being prosecuted.  (2) Any person conducting the prosecution may do so personally or by a pleader.  303. Right of person against whom proceedings are instituted to be defended.—Any person accused of an  offence  before  a  Criminal  Court,  or  against  whom  proceedings  are  instituted  under  this  Code,  may  of  right  be  defended by a pleader of his choice.  304.  Legal  aid  to  accused  at  State  expense  in certain  cases.—(1) Where,  in  a  trial  before  the  Court  of  Session,  the  accused  is  not  represented  by  a  pleader,  and  where  it  appears  to  the  Court  that  the  accused  has  not  sufficient means to engage a pleader, the Court shall assign a pleader for his defence at the expense of the State.  (2) The High Court may, with the previous approval of the State Government, make rules providing for—  (a) the mode of selecting pleaders for defence under sub-section (1);  (b) the facilities to be allowed to such pleaders by the Courts;  (c)  the  fees  payable  to  such  pleaders  by  the  Government,  and  generally,  for  carrying  out  the  purposes  of  sub-section (1).  (3) The  State  Government  may,  by  notification,  direct  that,  as  from  such  date  as  may  be  specified  in  the  notification, the provisions of sub-sections (1) and (2) shall apply in relation to any class of trials before other Courts  in the State as they apply in relation to trials before Courts of  Session.  305.  Procedure  when  corporation  or  registered  society  is  an  accused.—(1) In  this section, “corporation”  means  an  incorporated  company  or  other  body  corporate,  and  includes  a  society  registered  under  the  Societies  Registration Act, 1860 (21 of 1860).  (2) Where a corporation is the accused person or one of the accused persons in an inquiry or trial, it may appoint  a  representative  for  the  purpose  of  the  inquiry  or  trial  and  such  appointment  need  not  be  under  the  seal  of  the  corporation.    115    (3) Where a representative of a corporation appears, any requirement of this Code that anything shall be done in  the presence of the accused or shall be read or stated or explained to the accused, shall be construed as a requirement  that that thing shall be done in the presence of the representative or read or stated or explained to the representative,  and any requirement that the  accused shall be examined shall be construed as a requirement that the representative  shall be examined.  (4) Where  a  representative  of  a  corporation  does  not  appear,  any  such  requirement  as  is  referred  to  in  sub- section (3) shall not apply.  (5) Where a statement in writing purporting to be signed by the managing director of the corporation or by any  person (by whatever name called) having, or being one of the persons having the  management of the affairs of the  corporation  to  the effect  that  the  person  named  in  the  statement  has  been  appointed  as  the  representative  of  the  corporation for the purposes of this section, is filed, the Court shall, unless the contrary is proved, presume that such  person has been so appointed.  (6) If a question arises as to whether any person, appearing as the representative of a corporation in an inquiry  or trial before a Court is or is not such representative, the question shall be determined by the Court.  306. Tender of pardon to accomplice.—(1) With a view to obtaining the evidence of any person supposed to  have been directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to an offence to which this section applies, the Chief Judicial  Magistrate or a Metropolitan Magistrate at any stage of the investigation or inquiry into, or the trial of, the offence,  and  the  Magistrate  of  the  first  class  inquiring  into  or  trying  the  offence,  at  any  stage  of  the  inquiry  or  trial,  may  tender  a  pardon  to  such  person  on  condition  of  his  making  a  full  and  true  disclosure  of  the  whole  of  the  circumstances  within  his  knowledge  relative  to  the  offence  and  to  every  other  person  concerned,  whether  as  principal or abettor, in the commission thereof.  (2) This section applies to—  (a) any  offence  triable  exclusively  by  the  Court  of  Session  or  by  the  Court  of  a  Special  Judge  appointed  under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952 (46 of 1952);  (b) any  offence  punishable  with  imprisonment  which  may  extend  to  seven  years  or  with  a  more  severe  sentence.   (3) Every Magistrate who tenders a pardon under sub-section (1) shall record—  (a) his reasons for so doing;  (b) whether the tender was or was not accepted by the person to whom it was made,  and shall, on application made by the accused, furnish him with a copy of such record free of cost.  (4) Every person accepting a tender of pardon made under sub-section (1)—  (a) shall be  examined as a  witness in the  Court of the  Magistrate  taking cognizance of the  offence and in  the subsequent trial, if any;  (b) shall, unless he is already on bail, be detained in custody until the termination of the trial.  (5) Where a person has accepted a tender of pardon made  under sub-section (1) and has been examined under  sub-section (4), the  Magistrate  taking  cognizance  of  the  offence  shall,  without  making  any  further  inquiry in  the  case—  (a) commit it for trial—  (i) to the Court of Session if the offence is triable exclusively by that Court or if the Magistrate taking  cognizance is the Chief Judicial Magistrate;  (ii) to a Court of Special Judge appointed under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952 (46 of 1952),  if the offence is triable exclusively by that Court;  (b) in any other case, make over the case to the Chief Judicial Magistrate who shall try the case himself.  307. Power  to  direct  tender  of  pardon.—At  any  time  after  commitment  of  a  case  but  before  judgment  is  passed, the  Court to  which the  commitment is  made  may,  with a  view to obtaining at  the  trial the  evidence of any  person supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned in, or privy to, any such offence, tender a pardon on  the same condition to such person.   116    308.  Trial  of  person  not  complying  with  conditions  of  pardon.—(1) Where,  in  regard  to  a  person  who  has  accepted a tender of pardon made under section 306 or section 307, the Public Prosecutor certifies that in his opinion  such person has, either by wilfully concealing anything essential or by giving false evidence, not complied with the  condition  on  which  the  tender  was  made,  such  person  may  be  tried  for  the  offence  in  respect  of  which  the  pardon  was  so  tendered  or  for  any  other  offence  of  which  he  appears  to  have  been  guilty  in  connection  with  the  same  matter, and also for the offence of giving false evidence:  Provided that such person shall not be tried jointly with any of the other accused:  Provided  further that  such  person  shall  not  be  tried  for  the  offence  of  giving  false  evidence  except  with  the  sanction of the High Court, and nothing contained in section 195 or section 340 shall apply to that offence.  (2) Any  statement  made  by  such  person  accepting  the  tender  of  pardon  and  recorded  by  a  Magistrate  under  section 164 or by a Court under sub-section (4) of section 306 may be given in evidence against him at such trial.  (3) At such trial, the accused shall be entitled to plead that he has complied with the condition upon which such  tender  was  made;  in  which  case  it  shall  be  for  the  prosecution  to  prove  that  the  condition  has  not  been  complied  with.  (4) At such trial, the Court shall—  (a) if it is a Court of Session, before the charge is read out and explained to the accused;  (b) if it is the Court of a Magistrate, before the evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution is taken,  ask  the  accused  whether  he  pleads  that  he  has  complied  with  the  conditions  on  which  the  tender  of  pardon  was  made.                     (5) If the accused does so plead, the  Court  shall record the plea  and proceed  with the  trial  and it shall, before  passing  judgment  in  the  case,  find  whether  or  not    the    accused    has    complied    with    the  conditions  of  the            pardon,  and,    if  it  finds that  he  has  so  complied,  it  shall,  notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  this  Code,  pass  judgment of acquittal.  309.  Power  to  postpone  or  adjourn  proceedings.— 1 [(1) In  every  inquiry  or  trial  the  proceedings  shall  be  continued  from  day-to-day  until  all  the  witnesses  in  attendance  have  been  examined,  unless  the  Court  finds  the  adjournment of the same beyond the following day to be necessary for reasons to be recorded:  Provided  that  when  the  inquiry  or  trial  relates to  an  offence  under  section  376,  section  376A,  section  376B,  section 376C or section 376D of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), the inquiry or trial shall, as far as possible be  completed within a period of two months from the date of filing of the charge sheet.]   (2) If  the  Court,  after  taking  cognizance  of  an  offence,  or  commencement  of  trial,  finds  it  necessary  or  advisable to postpone the commencement of, or adjourn, any inquiry or trial, it may, from time to time, for reasons  to be recorded, postpone or adjourn the same on such terms as it thinks fit, for such time as it considers reasonable,   and may by a warrant remand the accused if in custody:  Provided that no Magistrate shall remand an accused person to custody under this section for a term exceeding  fifteen days at a time:  Provided  further  that  when  witnesses  are  in  attendance,  no  adjournment  or  postponement  shall  be  granted,  without examining them, except for special reasons to be recorded in writing:  2 [Provided  also  that  no  adjournment  shall  be  granted  for  the  purpose  only  of  enabling  the  accused  person  to  show cause against the sentence proposed to be imposed on him.]                                                    1.

Ins. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 24 (w.e.f. 18-12-1978).   117    1 [Provided also that—  (a)  no  adjournment  shall  be  granted  at  the  request  of  a  party,  except  where  the  circumstances  are  beyond  the control of that party;  (b) the fact that the pleader of a party is engaged in another Court, shall not be a ground for adjournment;  (c) where a witness is present in Court but a party or his pleader is not present or the party or his pleader  though  present  in  Court,  is  not  ready  to  examine  or  cross-examine  the  witness,  the  Court  may,  if  thinks  fit,  record the statement of the witness and pass such orders as it thinks fit dispensing with the examination-in-chief  or cross-examination of the witness, as the case may be.]  Explanation  1.—If  sufficient evidence  has  been  obtained  to  raise a  suspicion  that  the  accused  may  have  committed an offence, and it appears likely that further evidence may be obtained by a remand, this is a reasonable  cause for a remand.  Explanation 2.—The  terms on  which an adjournment or postponement  may be  granted include, in appropriate  cases, the payment of costs by the prosecution or the accused.  310. Local inspection.—(1) Any Judge or Magistrate may, at any stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding,  after due notice to the parties, visit and inspect any place in which an offence is alleged to have been committed, or  any other place in which it is in his opinion necessary to view for the purpose of properly appreciating the evidence  given  at  such  inquiry  or  trial,  and  shall without  unnecessary  delay  record  a  memorandum  of  any  relevant  facts  observed at such inspection.  (2) Such memorandum shall form part of the record of the case and if the prosecutor, complainant or accused or  any other party to the case, so desires, a copy of the memorandum shall be furnished to him free of cost.  311. Power to summon material witness, or examine person present.—Any Court may, at any stage of any  inquiry,  trial  or  other  proceeding  under  this  Code,  summon  any  person  as  a  witness,  or  examine  any  person  in  attendance,  though  not  summoned  as  a  witness,  or  recall  and  re-examine    any  person  already  examined;  and  the  Court    shall  summon  and  examine  or  recall  and  re-examine  any  such  person  if  his  evidence  appears  to  it  to  be  essential to the just decision of the case.  2 [311A. Power of Magistrate to order person to give specimen signatures or handwriting.—If a Magistrate  of the first class is satisfied that, for the purposes of any investigation or proceeding under this Code, it is expedient  to  direct any  person,  including  an  accused  person,  to  give  specimen  signatures  or  handwriting,  he  may  make  an  order to that effect and in that case the person to whom the order relates shall be produced or shall attend at the time  and place specified in such order and shall give his specimen signatures or handwriting:  Provided  that  no  order  shall  be  made  under  this  section  unless  the  person  has  at  some  time  been  arrested  in  connection with such investigation or proceeding.]  312.  Expenses  of  complainants  and  witnesses.—Subject  to  any  rules  made  by  the  State  Government,  any  Criminal Court may, if it thinks fit, order payment, on the part of the Government, of the reasonable expenses of any  complainant or witness attending for the purposes of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding before such Court under  this Code.  313.  Power  to  examine  the  accused.—(1) In  every  inquiry  or  trial,  for  the  purpose  of  enabling  the  accused  personally to explain any circumstances appearing in the evidence against him, the Court—  (a) may  at  any stage,  without  previously  warning  the  accused  put  such  questions  to  him  as  the  Court  considers necessary;  (b) shall,  after  the  witnesses  for  the  prosecution  have  been  examined  and  before  he  is  called  on  for  his  defence, question him generally on the case:  Provided that in a summons-case, where the Court has dispensed with the personal attendance of the accused, it  may also dispense with his examination under clause (b).   (2) No oath shall be administered to the accused when he is examined under sub-section (1).                                                    1. Ins. by Act 5 of 2009, s. 21 (w.e.f. 1-11-2010).   2. Ins. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 27 (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).   118    (3) The accused shall not render himself liable to punishment by refusing to answer such questions, or by giving  false answers to them.   (4) The  answers  given  by  the  accused  may  be  taken  into  consideration  in  such  inquiry  or  trial,  and  put  in  evidence for or against him in any other inquiry into, or trial for, any other offence which such answers may tend to  show he has committed.  1 [(5) The Court may take help of Prosecutor and Defence Counsel in preparing relevant questions which are to  be put to the accused and the Court may permit filing of written statement by the accused as sufficient compliance of  this section.]  314. Oral arguments and memorandum of arguments.—(1) Any party to a proceeding may, as soon as may  be, after the close of his evidence, address concise oral arguments, and may, before he concludes the oral arguments,  if  any,  submit  a  memorandum  to  the  Court  setting  forth  concisely  and  under  distinct  headings,  the  arguments  in  support of his case and every such memorandum shall form part of the record.  (2) A copy of every such memorandum shall be simultaneously furnished to the opposite party.  (3) No adjournment of the  proceedings shall be  granted  for the  purpose  of  filing the  written arguments unless  the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, considers it necessary to grant such adjournment.  (4) The  Court  may,  if  it  is  of  opinion  that  the  oral  arguments  are  not  concise  or  relevant,  regulate  such  arguments.  315.  Accused  person  to  be  competent  witness.—(1) Any  person  accused  of  an  offence  before  a  Criminal  Court shall be a competent witness for the defence and may give evidence on oath in disproof of the charges made  against him or any person charged together with him at the same trial:  Provided that—  (a) he shall not be called as a witness except on his own request in writing;  (b) his failure to give evidence shall not be  made the  subject of any comment by any of the parties or the  Court  or  give  rise  to  any  presumption  against  himself  or  any  person  charged  together  with  him  that  the  same  trial.  (2) Any person against whom proceedings are instituted in any Criminal Court under section 98, or section 107  or section 108, or section 109, or section 110, or under Chapter IX or under Part B, Part C or Part D of Chapter X,  may offer himself as a witness in such proceedings:  Provided that  in proceedings  under section 108, section 109, or section 110, the  failure  of such person to give  evidence  shall  not  be  made  the  subject  of  any  comment  by  any  of  the  parties  or  the  Court  or  give  rise  to  any  presumption against him or any other person proceeded against together with him at the same inquiry.  316. No influence to be used to induce disclosure.—Except as provided in sections 306 and 307, no influence,  by  means  of  any  promise  or  threat  or  otherwise,  shall  be  used  to  an  accused  person  to  induce  him  to  disclose  or  withhold any matter within his knowledge.  317.  Provision  for  inquiries  and  trial  being  held  in  the  absence  of  accused  in  certain  cases.—(1) At  any  stage of an inquiry or trial under this Code, if the Judge or Magistrate is satisfied, for reasons to be recorded, that the  personal  attendance  of  the  accused  before  the  Court  is  not  necessary  in  the  interests  of  justice,  or  that  the  accused  persistently  disturbs  the  proceedings  in  Court,  the  Judge  or  Magistrate  may,  if  the  accused  is  represented  by  a  pleader,  dispense  with  his  attendance  and  proceed  with  such  inquiry  or  trial  in  his  absence,  and  may,  at  any  subsequent stage of the proceedings, direct the personal attendance of such accused.  (2) If the  accused in any  such case  is not represented by a  pleader, or if the  Judge  or Magistrate  considers his  personal  attendance  necessary,  he  may,  if  he  thinks  fit  and  for  reasons  to  be  recorded  by  him,  either  adjourn  such  inquiry or trial, or order that the case of such accused be taken up or tried separately.                                                    1.

Procedure  where  accused  does  not  understand  proceedings.—If  the  accused,  though  not  of  unsound  mind,  cannot  be  made  to  understand  the  proceedings,  the  Court  may  proceed  with  the  inquiry  or  trial;  and, in  the  case  of  a  Court  other  than  a  High  Court,  if  such  proceedings  result  in  a  conviction,  the  proceedings  shall  be  forwarded to the  High  Court  with a  report of the  circumstances of the  case, and the  High Court shall pass thereon  such order as it thinks fit.  319. Power to proceed against other persons appearing to be guilty of offence.—(1) Where, in the course of  any  inquiry  into,  or  trial  of,  an  offence,  it  appears  from  the  evidence  that  any  person  not  being  the  accused  has  committed  any  offence  for  which such  person  could  be  tried  together  with  the  accused,  the  Court  may  proceed  against such person for the offence which he appears to have committed.   (2) Where such person is not attending the Court, he may be arrested or summoned, as the circumstances of the  case may require, for the purpose aforesaid.   (3) Any  person  attending  the  Court,  although  not  under  arrest  or  upon  a  summons,  may  be  detained  by  such  Court for the purpose of the inquiry into, or trial of, the offence which he appears to have committed.  (4) Where the Court proceeds against any person under sub-section (1), then—  (a) the proceedings in respect of such person shall be commenced afresh, and the witnesses re-heard;  (b) subject  to  the  provisions  of  clause (a), the  case  may  proceed  as  if  such  person  had  been  an  accused  person when the Court took cognizance of the offence upon which the inquiry or trial was commenced.  320.  Compounding  of  offences.—(1) The  offences  punishable  under  the  sections  of  the  Indian  Penal                  Code (45 of 1860) specified in the first two columns of the Table next following may be compounded by the persons  mentioned in the third column of that Table:—  1 [TABLE  Offence Section of the  Person by whom offence   Indian Penal may be compounded   Code applicable             1 2 3  Uttering words, etc., with deliberate 298 The person whose religious feelings  intent to wound the religious  are intended to be wounded.  feelings of any person.

(b) When the person who would otherwise be competent to compound an offence under this section is dead, the  legal  representative,  as  defined  in  the  Code  of  Civil  Procedure,  1908  (5  of  1908)  of  such  person  may,  with  the  consent of the Court, compound such offence.  (5) When the accused has been committed for trial or when he has been convicted and an appeal is pending, no  composition for the offence shall be allowed without the leave of the Court to which he is committed, or, as the case  may be, before which the appeal is to be heard.  (6) A  High  Court  or  Court  of  Session  acting  in  the exercise  of  its  powers  of  revision  under  section  401  may  allow any person to compound any offence which such person is competent to compound under this section.  (7) No  offence  shall  be  compounded  if  the  accused  is,  by  reason  of  a  previous  conviction,  liable  either  to  enhanced punishment or to a punishment of a different kind for such offence.  (8) The  composition  of  an  offence  under  this  section  shall  have  the  effect  of  an  acquittal  of  the  accused  with  whom the offence has been compounded.  (9) No offence shall be compounded except as provided by this section.   321. Withdrawal from prosecution.—The Public Prosecutor or Assistant Public Prosecutor in charge of a case  may, with the consent of the Court, at any time before the judgment is pronounced, withdraw from the prosecution  of any person either generally or in respect of any one or more of the offences for which he is tried; and, upon such  withdrawal,—  (a) if it is made before a charge has been framed, the accused shall be discharged in respect of such offence  or offences;  (b) if it is made after a charge has been framed, or when under this Code no charge is required, he shall be  acquitted in respect of such offence or offences:  Provided that where such offence—  (i) was against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, or  (ii) was   investigated   by   the   Delhi   Special   Police   Establishment   under   the   Delhi   Special   Police  Establishment Act, 1946 (25 of 1946), or  (iii) involved the  misappropriation or destruction of, or damage  to, any property belonging to the  Central  Government, or  (iv) was committed by a person in the service of the Central Government while acting or purporting to act  in the discharge of his official duty,                                                    1. Subs. by Act 5 of 2009, s. 23, for sub-section (3) (w.e.f. 31-12-2009).    124    and the Prosecutor in charge of the case has not been appointed by the Central Government, he shall not, unless he  has  been  permitted  by  the  Central  Government  to  do  so,  move  the  Court  for  its  consent  to  withdraw  from  the  prosecution and the Court shall, before according consent, direct the Prosecutor to produce before it the permission  granted by the Central Government to withdraw from the prosecution.  322.  Procedure  in  cases  which  Magistrate  cannot  dispose  of.—(1) If,  in  the  course  of  any  inquiry  into  an  offence or a trial before a Magistrate in any district, the evidence appears to him to warrant a presumption—  (a) that he has no jurisdiction to try the case or commit it for trial, or  (b) that the case is one which should be tried or committed for trial by some other Magistrate in the district,  or  (c) that the case should be tried by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, he shall stay the proceedings and submit  the  case,  with a  brief report explaining its  nature, to the  Chief Judicial  Magistrate  or to such other Magistrate,  having jurisdiction, as the Chief Judicial Magistrate directs.  (2) The Magistrate to whom the case is submitted may, if so empowered, either try the case himself, or refer it  to any Magistrate subordinate to him having jurisdiction, or commit the accused for trial.  323.   Procedure   when,   after   commencement   of   inquiry   or   trial,  Magistrate   finds   case   should   be  committed.—If, in any inquiry into an offence or a  trial before  a  Magistrate, it appears  to him at  any stage  of the  proceedings  before  signing  the  judgment  that  the  case  is  one  which  ought  to  be  tried  by  the  Court  of  Session,  he  shall commit it to that Court under the provisions hereinbefore contained  1 [and thereupon the provisions of Chapter  XVIII shall apply to the commitment so made].  324.  Trial  of  persons  previously  convicted  of  offences  against coinage,  stamp-law  or  property.— (1)  Where a person, having been convicted of an offence punishable under Chapter XII or Chapter XVII of the Indian  Penal Code, (45 of 1860) with imprisonment for a term of three years or upwards, is again accused of any offence  punishable  under  either  of  those  Chapters  with  imprisonment  for  a  term  of  three  years  or  upwards,  and  the  Magistrate  before  whom  the  case  is  pending  is  satisfied  that  there  is  ground  for  presuming  that  such  person  has  committed  the  offence,  he  shall be  sent  for  trial  to  the  Chief  Judicial  Magistrate  or  committed  to  the  Court  of  Session,  unless  the  Magistrate  is  competent  to  try  the  case  and  is  of  opinion  that  he  can  himself  pass  an  adequate  sentence if the accused is convicted.   (2) When  any  person  is sent  for  trial  to  the  Chief  Judicial  Magistrate  or  committed  to  the  Court  of  Session  under sub-section (1), any other person accused jointly with him in the same inquiry or trial shall be similarly sent or  committed, unless the Magistrate discharges such other person under section 239 or section 245, as the case may be.  325. Procedure when Magistrate cannot pass sentence sufficiently severe.—(1) Whenever a Magistrate is of  opinion, after hearing the evidence for the prosecution and the accused, that the accused is guilty, and that he ought  to  receive  a  punishment  different  in  kind  from,  or  more  severe  than,  that  which  such  Magistrate  is  empowered  to  inflict,  or,  being  a  Magistrate  of  the  second  class,  is  of  opinion  that  the  accused  ought  to  be  required  to  execute  a  bond  under  section  106,  he  may  record  the  opinion  and  submit  his  proceedings,  and  forward  the  accused,  to  the  Chief Judicial Magistrate to whom he is subordinate.  (2) When more accused than one are being tried together, and the Magistrate considers it necessary to proceed  under  sub-section (1), in  regard  to  any  of  such  accused,  he  shall  forward  all  the  accused,  who  are  in  his  opinion  guilty, to the Chief Judicial Magistrate.  (3) The  Chief  Judicial  Magistrate  to  whom  the  proceedings  are  submitted  may,  if  he  thinks  fit,  examine  the  parties and recall and examine any witness who has already given evidence in the case and may call for and take any  further evidence and shall pass such judgment, sentence or order in the case as he thinks fit, and is according to law.                                                    1. Ins. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 26 (w.e.f. 18-12-1978).    125    326.   Conviction   or   commitment   on   evidence   partly   recorded   by   one   Magistrate   and   partly   by                   another.—(1) Whenever any  1 [Judge  or Magistrate], after  having  heard and recorded the  whole  or any part of  the  evidence  in  any  enquiry  or  a  trial,  ceases  to  exercise  jurisdiction  therein  and  is  succeeded  by  another  1 [Judge  or  Magistrate]  who  has and  who exercises such jurisdiction, the  1 [Judge or Magistrate] so  succeeding  may act on  the  evidence so recorded by his predecessor, or partly recorded by his predecessor and partly recorded by himself:  Provided  that  if  the  succeeding  1 [Judge  or  Magistrate]  is  of  opinion  that  further  examination  of  any  of  the  witnesses whose evidence has already been recorded is necessary in the interests of Justice, he may re-summon any  such  witness,  and  after  such  further  examination,  cross-examination  and  re-examination,  if  any,  as  he  may  permit,  the witness shall be discharged.  (2) When a case is transferred under the provisions of this Code  2 [from one judge to another Judge or from one  Magistrate  to  another  Magistrate],  the  former  shall  be  deemed  to  cease  to  exercise  jurisdiction  therein,  and  to  be  succeeded by the latter, within the meaning of sub-section (1).  (3) Nothing in this section applies to summary trials or to cases in  which proceedings  have  been stayed under  section 322 or in which proceedings have been submitted to a superior Magistrate under section 325.  327. Court to be open.— 3 [(1)] The place in which any Criminal Court is held for the purpose of inquiring into  or trying any offence shall be deemed to be an open Court, to which the public generally may have access, so far as  the same can conveniently contain them:  Provided that the presiding Judge or Magistrate  may, if he thinks fit, order at any stage of any inquiry into, or  trial  of,  any  particular  case,  that  the  public  generally,  or  any  particular  person,  shall  not  have  access  to,  or  be  or  remain in, the room or building used by the Court.  4 [(2)  Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  sub- section  (1),  the  inquiry  into  and  trial  of  rape  or  an  offence  under  section  376,  section  376A,  section  376B,  section  376C,  5 [section 376D or  section  376E of  the  Indian  Penal  Code (45 of 1860)] shall be conducted in camera :  Provided that the presiding Judge may, if he thinks fit, or on an application made by either of the parties, allow  any particular person to have access to, or be or remain in,  the room or building used by the Court:  6 [Provided further that in camera trial shall be conducted as far as practicable by a woman Judge or Magistrate.]   (3) Where  any  proceedings  are  held  under  sub-section  (2),  it  shall  not  be  lawful  for  any  person  to  print  or  publish any matter in relation to any such proceedings except with the previous permission of the Court:]    6 [Provided that the ban on printing or publication of trial proceedings in relation to an offence of rape may be  lifted, subject to maintaining confidentiality of name and address of the parties.]   CHAPTER XXV  PROVISIONS AS TO ACCUSED PERSONS OF UNSOUND MIND  328. Procedure in  case  of  accused  being  lunatic.—(1) When  a  Magistrate  holding  an  inquiry  has  reason  to  believe  that  the  person  against  whom  the  inquiry  is  being  held  is  of  unsound  mind  and  consequently  incapable  of  making  his  defence,  the  Magistrate  shall  inquire  into  the  fact  of  such  unsoundness  of  mind,  and  shall  cause  such  person to be examined by the civil surgeon of the district or such other medical officer as the State Government may  direct, and thereupon shall examine such surgeon or other officer as a witness, and shall reduce the examination to  writing.                                                     1. Subs. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 27,  for “Magistrate”  (w.e.f. 18-12-1978).   2. Subs. by s. 27, ibid., for “from one Magistrate to another Magistrate”(w.e.f. 18-12-1978).  3.

Ins. by Act 5 of 2009, s. 24 (w.e.f. 31-12-2009).   126    1 [(1A) If the civil surgeon finds the accused to be of unsound mind, he shall refer such person to a psychiatrist  or  clinical  psychologist  for  care,  treatment  and  prognosis  of  the  condition  and  the  psychiatrist  or  clinical  psychologist, as the case may be, shall inform the Magistrate whether the accused is suffering from unsoundness of  mind or mental retardation:  Provided that if the accused is aggrieved by the information given by the psychiatric or clinical psychologist, as  the case may be, to the Magistrate, he may prefer an appeal before the Medical Board which shall consist of—  (a) head of psychiatry unit in the nearest government hospital; and   (b) a faculty member in psychiatry in the nearest medical college.]   (2) Pending  such  examination  and  inquiry,  the  Magistrate  may  deal  with  such  person  in  accordance  with  the  provisions of section 330.  2 [(3) If such Magistrate is informed that the person referred to in sub-section (1A) is a person of unsound mind,  the  Magistrate  shall  further  determine  whether  the  unsoundness  of  mind  renders  the  accused  incapable  of  entering  defence  and  if  the  accused  is  found  so  incapable,  the  Magistrate  shall  record  a  finding  to  that  effect,  and  shall  examine  the  record  of evidence  produced  by  the  prosecution  and  after  hearing  the  advocate  of  the  accused  but  without  questioning  the  accused,  if  he  finds  that  no prima  facie case  is  made  out  against  the  accused,  he  shall,  instead  of  postponing  the  enquiry,  discharge  the  accused and  deal  with  him  in  the  manner  provided  under         section 330:  Provided that if the Magistrate finds that a prima facie case is made out against the accused in respect of whom  a finding of unsoundness of mind is arrived at, he shall postpone the proceeding for such period, as in the opinion of  the  psychiatrist  or  clinical  psychologist,  is  required  for  the  treatment  of  the  accused,  and  order  the  accused  to  be  dealt with as provided under section 330.  (4)  If  such  Magistrate  is  informed  that  the  person  referred  to  in  sub-section  (1A)  is  a  person  with  mental  retardation,  the  Magistrate  shall  further  determine  whether  the  mental  retardation  renders  the  accused  incapable  of  entering defence, and if the accused is found so incapable, the Magistrate shall order closure of the inquiry and deal  with the accused in the manner provided under section 330.]   329.  Procedure  in  case  of  person  of  unsound  mind  tried  before  Court.—(1) If  at  the  trial  of  any  person  before a Magistrate or Court of Session, it appears to the Magistrate or Court that  such person is of unsound mind  and consequently incapable of making his defence, the Magistrate or Court shall, in the first instance, try the fact of  such unsoundness and incapacity, and if the Magistrate or Court, after considering such medical and other evidence  as  may  be  produced  before  him  or  it,  is  satisfied  of  the  fact,  he  or  it  shall  record  a  finding  to  that  effect  and  shall  postpone further proceedings in the case.  3 [(1A) If during trial, the Magistrate or Court of Sessions finds the accused to be of unsound mind, he or it shall  refer  such  person  to  a  psychiatrist  or  clinical  psychologist  for  care  and  treatment,  and  the  psychiatrist  or  clinical  psychologist,  as  the  case  may  be    shall  report  to  the  Magistrate  or  Court  whether the  accused  is  suffering  from  unsoundness of mind:  Provided that if the accused is aggrieved by the information given by the psychiatric or clinical psychologist, as  the case may be, to the Magistrate, he may prefer an appeal before the Medical Board which shall consist of—  (a) head of psychiatry unit in the nearest government hospital; and  (b) a faculty member in psychiatry in the nearest medical college.]   4 [(2)  If  such  Magistrate  or  Court  is  informed  that  the  person  referred  to  in  sub-section  (1A)  is  a person  of                                                    1.

(3) If the Magistrate or Court finds that a prima facie case is made out against the accused and he is incapable of  entering  defence  by  reason  of  mental  retardation,  he  or  it  shall  not  hold  the  trial  and  order  the  accused  to  be  dealt  with in accordance with section 330.]   1 [330. Release of person of unsound mind pending investigation or trial.—(1) Whenever a person if found  under  section 328 or section  329 to be  incapable  of entering defence by reason of  unsoundness of  mind or  mental  retardation, the Magistrate or Court, as the case may be shall, whether the case is one in which bail may be taken or  not, order release of such person on bail:  Provided that the accused is suffering from unsoundness of mind or mental retardation which does not mandate  in-patient  treatment  and  a  friend  or  relative  undertakes  to  obtain  regular  out-patient  psychiatric  treatment  from  the  nearest medical facility and to prevent from doing injury to himself or to any other person.  (2)  If  the  case  is  one  in  which,  in  the  opinion  of  the  Magistrate  or  Court,  as  the  case  may  be,  bail  cannot  be  granted or if an appropriate undertaking is not given, he or it shall order the accused to be kept in such a place where  regular psychiatric treatment can be provided, and shall report the action taken to the State Government:  Provided  that  no  order  for  the  detention  of the  accused  in  a  lunatic  asylum  shall  be  made  otherwise  than  in  accordance  with  such  rules  as  the  State  Government  may  have  made  under  the  Mental  Health  Act,  1987  (14  of  1987).  (3) Whenever a person is found under section 328 or section 329 to be incapable of entering defence by reason  of unsoundness of mind or mental retardation, the Magistrate or Court, as the case may be, shall keeping in view the  nature  of  the  act  committed  and  the  extent  of  unsoundness  of  mind  or  mental  retardation,  further  determine if  the  release of the accused can be ordered:  Provided that—  (a) if on the basis of medical opinion or opinion of a specialist, the Magistrate or Court, as the case may be,  decide  to  order  discharge  of  the  accused,  as  provided  under  section  328  or  section 329,  such  release  may  be  ordered, if sufficient security is given that the accused shall be prevented from doing injury to himself or to any  other person;  (b)  if  the  Magistrate  or  Court,  as  the  case  may  be,  is  of  opinion  that  discharge  of  the  accused  cannot  be  ordered, the  transfer of the  accused to a residential  facility  for persons of unsound  mind  or  mental retardation  may be ordered wherein the accused may be provided care and appropriate education and training.]   331.  Resumption  of  inquiry  or  trial.—(1) Whenever  an  inquiry  or  a  trial  is  postponed  under  section  328  or  section 329, the Magistrate or Court, as the case may be, may at any time after the person concerned has ceased to  be  of  unsound  mind,  resume  the  inquiry  or  trial  and  require  the  accused  to appear  or  be  brought  before  such  Magistrate or Court.

Procedure on accused appearing before Magistrate or Court.—(1) If, when the accused appears or is  again brought before the Magistrate or Court, as the case may be, the Magistrate or Court considers him capable of  making his defence, the inquiry or trial shall proceed.  (2) If the Magistrate or Court considers the accused to be still incapable of making his defence, the Magistrate  or Court shall act according to the provisions of section 328 or section 329, as the case may be, and if the accused is  found  to  be  of  unsound  mind  and  consequently  incapable  making  his  defence,  shall  deal  with  such  accused  in                                                    1.

When accused appears to have been of sound mind.—When the accused appears to be of sound mind at  the time of inquiry or trial, and the Magistrate is satisfied from the evidence given before him that there is reason to  believe  that  the  accused committed an act,  which, if he  had been of sound  mind,  would have  been an offence, and  that he was, at the time when the act was committed, by reason of unsoundness of mind, incapable of knowing the  nature  of  the  act  or  that  it  was  wrong  or  contrary  to  law,  the  Magistrate  shall  proceed  with  the  case,  and,  if  the  accused ought to be tried by the Court of Session, commit him for trial before the Court of Session.  334. Judgment of acquittal on ground of unsoundness of mind.—Whenever any person is acquitted upon the  ground that, at the time at  which he is alleged to have committed an offence, he  was, by reason of unsoundness of  mind, incapable of knowing the nature of the act alleged as constituting the offence, or that it was wrong or contrary  to law, the finding shall state specifically whether he committed the act or not.  335. Person acquitted on such ground to be detained in safe custody.—(1) Whenever the finding states that  the accused person committed the act alleged, the Magistrate or Court before whom or which the trial has been held,  shall, if such act would, but for the incapacity found, have constituted an offence,—   (a) order such person to be detained in safe custody in such place and manner as the Magistrate or Court  thinks fit; or  (b) order such person to be delivered to any relative or friend of such person.  (2) No order for the detention of the accused in a lunatic asylum shall be made under clause (a) of sub- section  (1) otherwise than in accordance with such rules as the State Government may have made under the Indian Lunacy  Act, 1912 (4 of 1912).  (3) No order for the delivery of the accused to a relative or friend shall be made under clause (b) of sub-section  (1) except  upon  the  application  of  such  relative  or  friend  and  on  his  giving  security  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Magistrate or Court that the person delivered shall—  (a) be properly taken care of and prevented from doing injury to himself or to any other person;  (b) be  produced for the  inspection of such officer, and at such times and places, as the  State Government  may direct.

Procedure where lunatic detained is declared fit to be released.—(1) If such person is detained under  the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 330, or section 335, and such Inspector-General or visitors shall certify  that,  in  his  or  their  judgment,  he  may  be  released  without  danger  of  his  doing  injury  to  himself  or  to  any  other  person,  the  State  Government  may  thereupon  order  him  to  be  released,  or  to  be  detained  in  custody,  or  to  be  transferred to a public lunatic asylum if he has not been already sent to such an asylum; and, in case it orders him to  be transferred to an asylum, may appoint a Commission, consisting of a Judicial and two medical officers.   129    (2) Such Commission shall make a formal inquiry into the state of mind of such person, take such evidence as is  necessary, and shall report to the State Government, which may order his release or detention as it thinks fit.  339.  Delivery  of  lunatic  to  care  of  relative  or  friend.—(1) Whenever  any  relative  or  friend  of  any  person  detained under the provisions of section 330 or section 335 desires that he shall be delivered to his care and custody,  the  State  Government  may,  upon  the  application  of  such  relative  or  friend  and  on  his  giving  security  to  the  satisfaction of such State Government, that the person delivered shall—  (a) be properly taken care of and prevented from doing injury to himself or to any other person;  (b) be  produced for the  inspection of such officer, and at such times and places, as the  State Government  may direct;  (c) in the case of a person detained under sub-section (2) of section 330, be produced when required before  such Magistrate or Court,   order such person to be delivered to such relative or friend.   (2) If the person so delivered is accused of any offence, the trial of which has been postponed by reason of his  being of unsound mind and incapable of making his defence, and the inspecting officer referred to in clause (b) of  sub-section (1), certifies at  any time  to the  Magistrate  or Court that such person is capable  of  making  his defence,  such Magistrate or Court shall call upon the relative or friend to whom such accused was delivered to produce him  before the Magistrate or Court; and, upon such production the Magistrate or Court shall proceed in accordance with  the provisions of section 332, and the certificate of the inspecting office shall be receivable as evidence.

(3) If such conviction is set aside on appeal or otherwise, such order shall become void.  (4) An  order  under  this  section  may  also  be  made  by  an  Appellate  Court  or  by  the  High  Court  or  Court  of  Session when exercising its powers of revision.  (5) The State Government may, by notification, make rules to carry out the provisions of this section relating to  the notification of residence or change of, or absence from, residence by released convicts.  (6) Such rules may provide for punishment for the breach thereof and any person charged with a breach of any  such rule may be tried by a Magistrate of competent jurisdiction in the district in which the place last notified by him  as his place of residence is situated.  357.

(2) If the fine is imposed in a case which is subject to appeal no such payment shall be made before the period  allowed for presenting the appeal has elapsed, or, if an appeal be presented, before the decision of the appeal.  (3) When  a  Court  imposes  a  sentence,  of  which  fine  does  not  form  a  part,  the  Court  may,  when  passing  judgment, order the accused person to pay, by way of compensation, such amount as may be specified in the order to  the  person  who  has  suffered  any  loss  or  injury  by  reason  of  the  act  for  which  the  accused  person  has  been  so  sentenced.  (4) An  order  under  this  section  may  also  be  made  by  an  Appellate  Court  or  by  the  High  Court  or  Court  of  Session when exercising its powers of revision.  (5) At  the  time  of  awarding  compensation  in  any  subsequent  civil  suit  relating  to  the  same  matter,  the  Court                                                    1. Ins. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 29 (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).   135    shall take into account any sum paid or recovered as compensation under this section.  1 [357A.  Victim  compensation  scheme.—(1) Every  State  Government  in  co-ordination  with  the  Central  Government  shall  prepare  a  scheme  for  providing  funds  for  the  purpose  of  compensation  to  the  victim  or  his  dependents who have suffered loss or injury as a result of the crime and who require rehabilitation.  (2) Whenever a recommendation is made by the Court for compensation, the District Legal Service Authority or  the  State  Legal  Service  Authority,  as  the  case  may  be,  shall  decide  the  quantum  of  compensation    to  be  awarded  under the scheme referred to in sub-section (1).  (3) If the  trial  Court,  at  the  conclusion of the trial, is  satisfied, that  the  compensation  awarded  under  section   357  is  not  adequate  for  such rehabilitation, or where the cases end in acquittal or discharge and the victim has to  be rehabilitated, it may make recommendation for compensation.  (4) Where the offender is not traced or identified, but the victim is identified, and where no trial takes place, the  victim or his dependents may make an application to the State or the District Legal Services Authority for award of  compensation.  (5)  On  receipt  of  such  recommendations  or  on  the  application  under  sub-section  (4),  the  State  or  the  District  Legal  Services  Authority  shall,  after  due  enquiry  award  adequate  compensation  by  completing  the  enquiry  within  two months.  (6)  The  State  or  the  District  Legal  Services  Authority,  as  the  case  may  be,  to  alleviate  the  suffering  of  the  victim,  may  order  for  immediate  first-aid  facility  or  medical  benefits  to  be  made  available  free  of  cost  on the  certificate of the police officer not below the rank of the officer in charge of the police station or a Magistrate of the  area concerned, or any other interim relief as the appropriate authority deems fit.]  2 [357B.  Compensation  to  be  in  addition  to  fine  under  section  326A  or  section  376D  of  Indian  Penal  Code.—The compensation payable by the State Government under section 357A shall be in addition to the payment  of fine to the victim under section 326A or section 376D of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).  357C.  Treatment  of  victims.—All  hospitals,  public  or  private,  whether  run  by  the  Central  Government,  the  State  Government,  local  bodies  or  any  other  person,  shall  immediately,  provide  the  first-aid  or  medical  treatment,  free  of  cost,  to  the  victims  of any  offence  covered  under  section  326A,  376,  376A,  376B,  376C,  376D  or  section  376E of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), and shall immediately inform the police of such incident.]  358. Compensation  to  persons  groundlessly  arrested.—(1) Whenever  any  person  causes  a  police  officer  to  arrest another  person, if it  appears to the Magistrate by  whom the case is heard that there was no sufficient ground  for causing such arrest, the Magistrate  may award such compensation, not exceeding  3 [one thousand rupees], to be  paid by the person so causing the arrest to the person so arrested, for his loss of time and expenses in the matter, as  the Magistrate thinks fit.  (2) In such cases,  if  more  persons than one  are  arrested, the  Magistrate  may, in like  manner, award to each of  them such compensation, not exceeding  3 [one thousand rupees], as such Magistrate thinks fit.   (3) All compensation awarded under this section may be recovered as if it were a fine, and, if it cannot be  so  recovered, the person by whom it is payable shall be sentenced to simple imprisonment for such term not exceeding  thirty days as the Magistrate directs, unless such sum is sooner paid.  359. Order to pay costs in non-cognizable cases.—(1) Whenever any complaint of a non-cognizable offence  is made to a Court, the Court, if it convicts the accused, may, in addition to the penalty imposed upon him, order him  to pay to the complainant, in whole or in part, the cost incurred by him in the prosecution, and may further order that  in default of payment, the accused shall suffer simple imprisonment for a period not exceeding thirty days and such  costs  may  include  any  expenses  incurred  in  respect  of  process-fees,  witnesses  and  pleader's  fees  which  the  Court  may consider reasonable.  (2) An  order  under  this  section  may  also  be  made  by  an  Appellate  Court  or  by  the  High  Court  or  Court  of  Session when exercising its powers of revision.  360. Order to release on probation of good conduct or after admonition.—(1) When any person not under                                                    1.

Subs. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 30,  for “one hundred rupees” (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).   136    twenty-one  years  of  age  is  convicted  of  an  offence  punishable  with  fine  only  or  with  imprisonment  for  a  term  of  seven years or less, or when any person under twenty-one years of age or any woman is convicted of an offence not  punishable  with  death  or  imprisonment  for  life,  and  no  previous  conviction  is  proved  against  the  offender,  if  it  appears  to  the  Court  before  which  he  is  convicted,  regard  being  had  to  the  age, character  or  antecedents  of  the  offender, and to the circumstances in which the offence was committed, that it is expedient that  the  offender should  be  released  on  probation  of  good  conduct,  the  Court  may,  instead  of  sentencing  him  at  once  to  any  punishment,  direct that he be released on his entering into a bond, with or without sureties, to appear and receive sentence when  called upon during such period (not exceeding three years) as the Court may direct, and in the meantime to keep the  peace and be of good behaviour:  Provided that where any first offender is convicted by a Magistrate of the second class not specially empowered  by the High Court, and the Magistrate is of opinion that the powers conferred by this section should be exercised, he  shall record his opinion to that effect,  and submit the  proceedings to a  Magistrate  of the  first class, forwarding the  accused  to,  or taking  bail  for  his  appearance  before,  such  Magistrate,  who  shall  dispose  of  the  case  in  the  manner  provided by sub-section (2).  (2) Where proceedings are submitted to a Magistrate of the first class as provided by sub-section (1), such Magistrate  may thereupon pass such sentence or make such order as he might have passed or made if the case had originally been  heard  by  him,  and,  if  he  thinks  further  inquiry  or  additional  evidence  on  any  point  to  be  necessary,  he  may  make  such  inquiry or take such evidence himself or direct such inquiry or evidence to be made or taken.  (3) In any case in which a person is convicted of theft, theft in a building, dishonest misappropriation, cheating  or any offence under the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), punishable with not more than two years, imprisonment or  any offence punishable with fine only and no previous conviction is proved against him, the Court before which he  is so convicted may, if it thinks fit, having regard to the age, character, antecedents or physical or mental condition  of the offender and to the trivial nature of the offence or any extenuating circumstances under which the offence was  committed, instead of sentencing him to any punishment, release him after due admonition.  (4) An order under this section may be made by any Appellate Court or by the High Court or Court of Session  when exercising its powers of revision.  (5) When  an  order  has  been  made  under  this  section  in  respect  of  any  offender,  the  High  Court  or  Court  of  Session may, on appeal when there is a right of appeal to such Court, or when exercising its powers of revision, set  aside such order, and in lieu thereof pass sentence on such offender according to law:  Provided  that  the  High  Court  or  Court  of  Session  shall  not  under  this  sub-section  inflict  a  greater  punishment  than might have been inflicted by the Court by which the offender was convicted.  (6) The provisions of sections 121, 124 and 373 shall, so far as may be, apply in the case of sureties offered in  pursuance of the provisions of this section.  (7) The  Court,  before  directing  the  release  of  an  offender  under  sub-section  (1),  shall  be  satisfied  that  an  offender or his surety (if any) has a fixed place of abode or regular occupation in the place for which the Court acts  or in which the offender is likely to live during the period named for the observance of the conditions.   (8) If the Court which convicted the offender, or a Court which could have dealt with the offender in respect of  his original offence, is satisfied that the offender has failed to observe any of the conditions of his recognizance, it  may issue a warrant for his apprehension.  (9) An offender, when apprehended on any such warrant, shall be brought forthwith before the Court issuing the  warrant,  and  such  Court  may  either  remand  him  in  custody  until  the  case  is  heard  or  admit  him  to  bail  with  a  sufficient  surety  conditioned  on  his  appearing  for  sentence  and  such  Court  may,  after  hearing  the  case,  pass  sentence.  (10) Nothing in this section shall affect the provisions of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 (20 of 1958), or  the  Children  Act,  1960  (60  of  1960)  or  any  other  law  for  the  time  being  in  force  for  the  treatment,  training  or  rehabilitation of youthful offenders.   361. Special reasons to be recorded in certain cases.—Where in any case the Court could have dealt with,—  (a) an  accused  person  under  section  360  or  under  the  provisions  of  the  Probation  of  Offenders  Act,  1958  (20 of 1958); or   (b) a  youthful offender under the  Children  Act, 1960 (60 of 1960) or any other law  for the  time  being in  force for the treatment, training or rehabilitation of youthful offenders,    137    but has not done so, it shall record in its judgment the special reasons for not having done so.  362. Court not to alter judgment.—Save as otherwise provided by this Code or by any other law for the time  being in force, no Court, when it has signed its judgment or final order disposing of a case, shall alter or review the  same except to correct a clerical or arithmetical error.  363. Copy of judgment to be given to the accused and other persons.—(1) When the accused is sentenced to  imprisonment, a copy of the judgment shall, immediately after the pronouncement of the judgment, be given to him  free of cost.  (2) On the  application of the  accused, a  certified copy of the  judgment,  or  when he  so desires, a  translation in  his own language if practicable or in the language of the Court, shall be given to him without delay, and such copy  shall, in every case where the judgment is appealable by the accused, be given free of cost:  Provided  that  where  a  sentence  of  death  is  passed  or  confirmed  by  the  High  Court,  a  certified  copy  of  the  judgment shall be immediately given to the accused free of cost whether or not he applies for the same.  (3) The  provisions  of  sub-section (2) shall  apply  in  relation  to  an  order  under  section  117  as  they  apply  in  relation to a judgment which is appealable by the accused.  (4) When the accused is sentenced to death by any Court and an appeal lies from such judgment as of right, the  Court shall inform him of the period within which, if he wishes to appeal, his appeal should be preferred.  (5) Save  as  otherwise  provided  in  sub-section (2), any  person  affected  by  a  judgment  or  order  passed  by  a  Criminal  Court  shall,  on  an  application  made  in  this  behalf and  on  payment  of  the  prescribed  charges,  be  given  a  copy of such judgment or order or of any deposition or other part of the record:  Provided that the Court may, if it thinks fit for some special reason, give it to him free of cost.  (6) The High Court may, by rules, provide for the grant of copies of any judgment or order of a Criminal Court  to any person who is not affected by a judgment or order, on payment, by such person, of such fees, and subject to  such conditions, as the High Court may, by such rules, provide.  364.  Judgment  when  to  be  translated.—The  original judgment  shall  be  filed  with  the  record  of  the  proceedings  and where  the  original  is  recorded  in  a  language  different  from  that  of  the  Court,  and  the  accused  so  requires, a translation thereof into the language of the Court shall be added to such record.  365. Court of Session to send copy of finding and sentence to District Magistrate.—In cases tried by the Court  of Session or a Chief Judicial Magistrate, the Court or such Magistrate, as the case may be, shall forward a copy of its  or his finding and sentence (if any) to the District Magistrate within whose local jurisdiction the trial was held.  CHAPTER XXVIII  SUBMISSION OF DEATH SENTENCES FOR CONFIRMATION  366.  Sentence  of  death  to  be  submitted  by Court  of  Session  for  confirmation.—(1) When  the  Court  of  Session passes a sentence of death, the proceedings shall be submitted to the High Court, and the sentence shall not  be executed unless it is confirmed by the High Court.  (2) The Court passing the sentence shall commit the convicted person to jail custody under a warrant.  367. Power  to  direct  further  inquiry  to  be  made  or  additional  evidence  to  be  taken.—(1) If,  when  such  proceedings are submitted, the High Court thinks that a further inquiry should be made into, or additional evidence  taken upon, any point bearing upon the guilt or innocence of the convicted person, it may make such inquiry or take  such evidence itself, or direct it to be made or taken by the Court of Session.   (2) Unless the High Court otherwise directs, the presence of the convicted person may be dispensed with when  such inquiry is made or such evidence is taken.   138    (3) When the inquiry or evidence (if any) is not made or taken by the High Court, the result of such inquiry or  evidence shall be certified to such Court.  368.  Power  of  High  Court  to  confirm  sentence  or  annul  conviction.—In  any  case  submitted  under                    section 366, the High Court—  (a) may confirm the sentence, or pass any other sentence warranted by law, or  (b) may annul the conviction and convict the accused of any offence of which the  Court of Session might  have convicted him, or order a new trial on the same or an amended charge, or  (c) may acquit the accused person:  Provided that no order of confirmation shall be made under this section until the period allowed for preferring an  appeal has expired, or, if an appeal is presented within such period, until such appeal is disposed of.  369.  Confirmation  or  new  sentence  to  be  signed  by  two  Judges.—In  every  case  so submitted,  the  confirmation  of  the  sentence,  or  any  new  sentence  or  order  passed  by  the  High  Court,  shall,  when  such  Court  consists of two or more Judges, be made, passed and signed by at least two of them.  370. Procedure in case of difference of opinion.—Where any such case is heard before a Bench of Judges and  such Judges are equally divided in opinion, the case shall be decided in the manner provided by section 392.  371.  Procedure  in  cases  submitted  to  High  Court  for  confirmation.—In  cases  submitted  by  the  Court  of  Session  to  the  High  Court  for  the  confirmation  of  a  sentence  of  death,  the  proper  officer  of  the  High  Court  shall,  without delay, after the  order of confirmation or other order has been  made  by the  High  Court,  send a  copy of the  order, under the seal of the High Court and attested with his official signature, to the Court of Session.  CHAPTER XXIX  APPEALS  372.  No  appeal  to  lie  unless  otherwise  provided.—No  appeal  shall  lie  from  any  judgment  or  order  of  a  Criminal Court except as provided for by this Code  by any other law for the time being in force:  1 [Provided that the victim shall have a right to prefer an appeal against any order passed by the Court acquitting  the accused or convicting for a lesser offence or imposing inadequate compensation, and such appeal shall lie to the  Court to which an appeal ordinarily lies against the order of conviction of such Court.]  373. Appeal from orders requiring security or  refusal to accept or  rejecting surety for  keeping peace or  good behaviour.—Any person,—  (i) who has been ordered under section 117 to give security for keeping the peace or for good behaviour, or  (ii) who is aggrieved by any order refusing to accept or rejecting a surety under section 121,  may appeal against such order to the Court of Session:   Provided  that  nothing  in  this  section  shall  apply  to  persons  the  proceedings  against  whom  are  laid  before  a  Sessions Judge in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (2) or sub-section (4) of section 122.  374.

Summary  dismissal of appeal.—(1) If upon examining the petition of appeal and  copy of the  judgment  received  under  section  382  or  section  383,  the  Appellate  Court  considers  that  there  is  no  sufficient  ground  for  interfering, it may dismiss the appeal summarily:  Provided that—  (a) no appeal presented under section 382 shall be dismissed unless the appellant or his pleader has had a  reasonable opportunity of being heard in support of the same;  (b) no appeal presented under section 383 shall be dismissed except after giving the appellant a reasonable  opportunity  of  being  heard  in  support  of  the  same,  unless  the  Appellate  Court  considers  that  the  appeal  is  frivolous or that the production of the accused in custody before the Court would involve such inconvenience as  would be disproportionate in the circumstances of the case;   (c) no  appeal  presented  under  section  383  shall  be  dismissed  summarily  until  the  period  allowed  for  preferring such appeal has expired.  (2) Before dismissing an appeal under this section, the Court may call for the record of the case.  (3) Where  the  Appellate  Court  dismissing  an  appeal  under  this  section  is  a  Court  of  Session  or  of  the  Chief  Judicial Magistrate, it shall record its reasons for doing so.   (4) Where  an  appeal  presented  under  section  383  has  been  dismissed  summarily  under  this  section  and  the  Appellate  Court  finds  that  another  petition  of  appeal  duly  presented  under  section  382  on  behalf  of  the  same  appellant  has  not  been  considered  by  it,  that  Court  may,  notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  section  393,  if  satisfied that it is necessary in the  interests of justice so to do, hear and dispose of such appeal in accordance with  law.   142    385. Procedure for hearing appeals not dismissed summarily.—(1) If the Appellate Court does not dismiss  the appeal summarily, it shall cause notice of the time and place at which such appeal will be heard to be given—  (i) to the appellant or his pleader;   (ii) to such officer as the State Government may appoint in this behalf;  (iii) if the appeal is from a judgment of conviction in a case instituted upon complaint, to the complainant;  (iv) if  the  appeal  is  under  section  377  or  section  378,  to  the  accused,  and  shall  also  furnish  such  officer,  complainant and accused with a copy of the grounds of appeal.  (2) The Appellate Court shall then send for the record of the case, if such record is not already available in that  Court, and hear the parties:  Provided that if the appeal is only as to the extent or the legality of the sentence, the Court may dispose of the  appeal without sending for the record.  (3) Where  the  only  ground  for  appeal  from  a  conviction  is  the  alleged  severity  of  the  sentence,  the  appellant  shall not, except with the leave of the Court, urge or be heard in support of any other ground.  386. Powers of the Appellate Court.—After perusing such record and hearing the appellant or his pleader, if  he appears, and the Public Prosecutor if he appears, and in case of an appeal under section 377 or section 378, the  accused,  if  he  appears,  the  Appellate Court  may,  if  it  considers  that  there  is  no  sufficient  ground  for  interfering,  dismiss the appeal, or may—  (a) in  an  appeal  from  an  order  or  acquittal,  reverse  such  order  and  direct  that  further  inquiry  be  made,  or  that the accused be re-tried or committed for trial, as the case  may be, or find him guilty and pass sentence on  him according to law;  (b) in an appeal from a conviction—   (i) reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or discharge the accused, or order him to be re-tried by a  Court of competent jurisdiction subordinate to such Appellate Court or committed for trial, or  (ii) alter the finding, maintaining the sentence, or   (iii) with or without altering the finding, alter the nature or the extent, or the nature and extent, of the  sentence, but not so as to enhance the same—  (c) in an appeal for enhancement of sentence—  (i) reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or discharge the accused or order him to be re-tried by a  Court competent to try the offence, or  (ii) alter the finding maintaining the sentence, or   (iii) with or without altering the finding, alter the nature or the extent, or, the nature and extent, of the  sentence, so as to enhance or reduce the same;  (d) in an appeal from any other order, alter or reverse such order;  (e) make any amendment or any consequential or incidental order that may be just or proper:  Provided  that  the  sentence  shall  not  be  enhanced  unless  the  accused  has  had  an  opportunity  of  showing  cause  against such enhancement:  Provided  further  that  the  Appellate  Court  shall  not  inflict  greater  punishment  for  the  offence  which  in  its  opinion the accused has committed, than might have been inflicted for that offence by the Court passing the order or  sentence under appeal.   143    387. Judgments of Subordinate Appellate Court.—The rules contained in Chapter XXVII as to the judgment  of a Criminal Court of original jurisdiction shall apply, so far as may be practicable, to the judgment in appeal of a  Court of Session or Chief Judicial Magistrate:  Provided that, unless the Appellate Court otherwise directs, the accused shall not be brought up, or required to  attend, to hear  judgment delivered.  388.  Order  of  High  Court  on  appeal  to  be  certified  to  lower  Court.—(1) Whenever  a  case  is  decided  on  appeal by the High Court under this Chapter, it shall certify its judgment or order to the Court by which the finding,  sentence  or  order  appealed  against  was  recorded  or  passed  and  if  such  Court  is  that  of  a  Judicial  Magistrate  other  than  the  Chief  Judicial  Magistrate,  the  High  Court's  judgment  or order  shall  be  sent  through  the  Chief  Judicial  Magistrate, and if such Court is that of an Executive Magistrate, the High Court’s judgment or order shall be sent  through the District Magistrate.  (2) The Court to which the High Court certifies its judgment or order shall thereupon make such orders as are  conformable  to  the  judgment  or  order  of  the  High  Court;  and  if  necessary,  the  record  shall  be  amended  in  accordance therewith.  389. Suspension of sentence pending the appeal; release of appellant on bail.—(1) Pending any appeal by a  convicted person, the Appellate Court may, for reasons to be recorded by it in writing, order that the execution of the  sentence or order appealed against be suspended and, also, if he is in confinement, that he be released on bail, or on  his own bond:   1 [Provided that the Appellate Court shall, before releasing on bail or on his own bond a convicted person  who is  convicted of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of not less than ten  years, shall give opportunity to the Public Prosecutor for showing cause in writing against such release:  Provided  further  that  in  cases  where  a  convicted  person  is  released  on  bail  it  shall  be  open  to  the  Public  Prosecutor to file an application for the cancellation of the bail.]  (2) The  power conferred by this  section on a  Appellate  Court  may be  exercised also by  the  High Court in the  case of an appeal by a convicted person to a Court subordinate thereto.  (3) Where the convicted person satisfies the Court by which he is convicted that he intends to present an appeal,  the Court shall,—  (i) where such person, being on bail, is sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, or  (ii) where the offence of which such person has been convicted is a bailable one, and he is on bail,   order that the convicted person be released on bail, unless there are special reasons for refusing bail, for such period as  will afford sufficient time to present the appeal and obtain the orders of the Appellate Court under sub-section (1); and  the sentence of imprisonment shall, so long as he is so released on bail, be deemed to be suspended.  (4) When the appellant is ultimately sentenced to imprisonment for a term or to imprisonment for life, the time  during which he is so released shall be excluded in computing the term for which he is so sentenced.  390. Arrest of accused in appeal from acquittal.—When an appeal is presented under section 378, the High  Court may issue a warrant directing that the accused be arrested and brought before it or any Subordinate Court, and  the Court before which he is brought may commit him to prison pending the disposal of the appeal or admit him to  bail.  391.  Appellate  Court  may  take  further  evidence  or  direct  it  to  be  taken.—(1) In  dealing with  any  appeal  under this Chapter, the Appellate Court, if it thinks additional evidence to be necessary, shall record its reasons and  may either take such evidence itself, or direct it to be taken by a Magistrate  or, when the Appellate Court is a High  Court, by a Court of Session or a Magistrate.  (2) When the additional evidence is taken by the  Court of Session or the Magistrate, it or he shall certify such  evidence to the Appellate Court, and such Court shall thereupon proceed to dispose of the appeal.                                                    1. Ins. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 33 (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).   144    (3) The accused or his pleader shall have the right to be present when the additional evidence is taken.  (4) The taking of evidence under this section shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter XXIII, as if it were an  inquiry.  392. Procedure where Judges of Court of Appeal are equally divided.—When an appeal under this Chapter  is heard by a High Court before a Bench of Judges and they are divided in opinion, the appeal, with their opinions,  shall be laid before another Judge of that Court, and that Judge, after such hearing as he thinks fit, shall deliver his  opinion, and the judgment or order shall follow that opinion:  Provided  that  if  one  of  the  Judges  constituting  the  Bench,  or,  where  the  appeal  is  laid  before  another  Judge  under this section, that Judge, so requires, the appeal shall be re-heard and decided by a larger Bench of Judges.  393. Finality of judgments and orders on appeal.—Judgments and orders passed by an Appellate Court upon  an appeal shall be final, except in the cases provided for in section 377, section 378, sub-section (4) of section 384  or Chapter XXX:  Provided that notwithstanding the final disposal of an appeal against conviction in any case, the Appellate Court  may hear and dispose of, on the merits,—  (a) an appeal against acquittal under section 378, arising out of the same case, or  (b) an appeal for the enhancement of sentence under section 377, arising out of the same case.  394. Abatement of appeals.—(1) Every other appeal under section 377 or section 378 shall finally abate on the  death of the accused.  (2) Every other appeal under this Chapter (except an appeal from a  sentence of fine) shall finally abate on the  death of the appellant:  Provided  that  where  the  appeal  is  against  a  conviction  and  sentence  of  death  or  of  imprisonment,  and  the  appellant dies during the pendency of the appeal, any of his near relatives may, within thirty days of the death of the  appellant, apply to the Appellate Court for leave to continue the appeal; and if leave is granted, the appeal shall not  abate.  Explanation.—In this section, \"near relative\" means a parent, spouse, lineal descendant, brother or sister.   CHAPTER XXX  REFERENCE AND REVISION  395.  Reference  to  High  Court.—(1) Where  any  Court  is  satisfied  that  a  case  pending  before  it  involves  a  question as to the validity of any Act, Ordinance or Regulation or of any provision contained  in an  Act, Ordinance  or Regulation, the determination of which is necessary for the disposal of the case, and is of opinion that such Act,  Ordinance,  Regulation  or  provision  is  invalid  or  inoperative, but  has  not  been  so  declared  by  the  High  Court  to  which that Court is Subordinate or by the Supreme Court, the Court shall state a case setting out its opinion and the  reasons therefor, and refer the same for the decision of the High Court.  Explanation.—In this section, \"Regulation\" means any Regulation as defined in the General Clauses Act, 1897  (10 of 1897), or in the General Clauses Act of a State.  (2) A Court of Session or a Metropolitan Magistrate  may, if it or he thinks fit in any case pending before it or  him to which the provisions of sub-section (1) do not apply, refer for the decision of the High Court any question of  law arising in the hearing of such case.  (3) Any Court making a reference to the High Court under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) may, pending the  decision of the  High  Court thereon, either commit the  accused to jail or release  him on  bail to appear when called  upon.   145    396.  Disposal  of  case  according  to  decision  of  High  Court.—(1) When  a  question  has been  so  referred,  the  High Court shall pass such order thereon as it thinks fit, and shall cause a copy of such order to be sent to the Court  by which the reference was made, which shall dispose of the case conformably to the said order.  (2) The High Court may direct by whom the costs of such reference shall be paid.  397. Calling for records to exercise powers of revision.—(1) The High Court or any Sessions Judge may call  for  and  examine  the  record  of  any  proceeding  before  any  inferior  Criminal  Court  situate  within  its  or  his  local  jurisdiction  for  the  purpose  of  satisfying  itself  or  himself;  to  the  correctness,  legality  or  propriety  of  any  finding,  sentence or order, recorded or passed, and as to the regularity of any proceedings of such inferior Court, and may,  when calling, for such record, direct that the execution of any sentence or order be suspended, and if the accused is  in confinement that he be released on bail or on his own bond pending the examination of the record.  Explanation.—All  Magistrates,  whether  Executive  or  Judicial,  and  whether  exercising  original  or  appellate  jurisdiction,  shall  be  deemed  to  be  inferior  to  the  Sessions  Judge  for  the  purposes  of  this  sub-section  and  of               section 398.  (2) The  powers  of  revision  conferred  by  sub-section (1) shall  not  be  exercised  in  relation  to  any  interlocutory  order passed in any appeal, inquiry, trial or other proceeding.  (3) If an application under this section has been made by any person either to the High Court or to the Sessions  Judge, no further application by the same person shall be entertained by the other of them.  398. Power to order inquiry.—On examining any record under section 397 or otherwise, the High Court or the  Sessions Judge may direct the Chief Judicial Magistrate by himself or by any of the Magistrates subordinate to him  to make, and the Chief Judicial Magistrate may himself make or direct any subordinate Magistrate to make, further  inquiry into any complaint which has been dismissed under section 203 or sub-section (4) of section 204, or into the  case of any person accused of an offence who has been discharged:  Provided that no Court shall make any direction under this section for inquiry into the case of any person who  has been discharged unless such person has had an opportunity of showing cause why such direction should not be  made.  399.  Sessions  Judge's  powers  of  revision.—(1) In  the  case  of  any  proceeding  the  record  of  which  has  been  called for by himself, the Sessions Judge may exercise all or any of the powers which may be exercised by the High  Court under sub-section (1) of section 401.  (2) Where any proceeding by way of revision is commenced before a Sessions Judge under sub-section (1), the  provisions of sub-sections (2), (3), (4) and (5) of section 401 shall, so far as may be, apply to such proceeding and  references in the said sub-sections to the High Court shall be construed as references to the Sessions Judge.  (3) Where  any  application  for  revision  is  made  by  or  on  behalf  of  any  person  before  the  Sessions  Judge,  the  decision of the Sessions Judge thereon in relation to such person shall be final and no further proceeding by way of  revision at the instance of such person shall be entertained by the High Court or any other Court.  400. Power of Additional Sessions Judge.—An Additional Sessions Judge shall have and may exercise all the  powers of a Sessions Judge under this Chapter in respect of any case  which may be transferred to him by or under  any general or special order of the Sessions Judge.  401. High Court's powers of revision.—(1) In the case of any proceeding the record of which has been called  for by itself or  which otherwise  comes to its knowledge, the  High  Court  may, in its discretion, exercise any of the  powers conferred on a Court of Appeal by sections 386, 389, 390 and 391 or on a Court of Session by section 307,  and, when the Judges composing the Court of Revision are equally divided in opinion, the case shall be disposed of  in the manner provided by section 392.  (2) No order under this section shall be made to the prejudice of the accused or other person unless he has had  an opportunity of being heard either personally or by pleader in his own defence.   146     (3) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorise a High Court to convert a finding of acquittal into one  conviction.  (4) Where under this Code an appeal lies and no appeal is brought,  no proceeding by way of revision shall be  entertained at the instance of the party who could have appealed.  (5) Where  under  this  Code  an  appeal  lies  but  an  application  for  revision  has  been  made  to  the  High  Court  by  any person and the High Court is satisfied that such application was made under the erroneous belief that no appeal  lies thereto and that it is necessary in the interests of Justice so to do, the High Court may treat the application for  revision as a petition of appeal and deal with the same accordingly.  402. Power  of  High  Court  to  withdraw  or  transfer  revision  cases.—(1) Whenever  one  or  more  persons  convicted at the same trial makes or make application to a High Court for revision and any  other person  convicted at  the same trial makes an  application to the Sessions Judge for revision, the High Court shall decide, having regard to the  general  convenience    of  the    parties  and  the  importance  of  the  questions  involved,  which  of  the  two  Courts    should   finally dispose of  the applications  for revision  and  when the  High  Court decides that all the applications  for revision  should  be  disposed  of  by    itself,  the  High  Court  shall  direct  that  the  applications  for  revision  pending  before  the   Sessions Judge be transferred to itself and where the High Court decides that it is not necessary for it to dispose of the  applications for revision, it shall direct that the applications for revision made to it be transferred to the Sessions Judge.  (2) Whenever any application for revision is transferred to the High Court, that Court shall deal with the same  as if it were an application duly made before itself.  (3) Whenever  any  application  for  revision  is  transferred  to  the  Sessions  Judge,  that  Judge  shall  deal  with  the  same as if it were an application duly made before himself.  (4) Where  an  application  for  revision  is  transferred  by  the  High  Court  to  the  Sessions  Judge,  no  further  application  for  revision  shall  lie  to  the  High  Court  or  to  any  other  Court  at  the  instance  of  the  person  or  persons  whose applications for revision have been disposed of by the Sessions Judge.  403. Option of Court to hear parties.—Save as otherwise expressly provided by this Code, no party has any  right  to  be heard  either  personally  or  by  pleader  before  any  Court  exercising  its  powers  of  revision;  but  the  Court  may, if it thinks fit, when exercising such powers, hear any party either personally or by pleader.  404. Statement by Metropolitan Magistrate of grounds of his decision to be considered by High Court.— When the record of any trial held by a Metropolitan Magistrate is called for by the High Court or Court of Session  under section 397, the Magistrate may submit with the record a statement setting forth the grounds of his decision or  order  and  any  facts  which  he  thinks  material  to  the  issue,  and  that  Court  shall  consider  such  statement  before  overruling or setting aside the said decision or order.  405. High Court's order to be certified to lower Court.—When a case is revised under this Chapter by the  High Court or a Sessions Judge, it or he shall, in the manner provided by section 388, certify its decision or order to  the  Court  by  which  the  finding,  sentence  or  order  revised  was  recorded  or  passed,  and  the  Court  to  which  the  decision  or  order  is  so  certified  shall  thereupon    make  such  orders  as  are  conformable  to  the  decision  so  certified,  and, if necessary, the record shall be amended in accordance therewith.  CHAPTER XXXI  TRANSFER OF CRIMINAL CASES  406.  Power of  Supreme  Court  to  transfer  cases  and  appeals.—(1) Whenever  it  is  made  to  appear  to  the  Supreme Court that an order under this section is expedient for the ends of justice, it may direct that any particular  case  or appeal be  transferred from one  High Court to another High  Court or from a  Criminal  Court subordinate  to  one High Court to another Criminal Court of equal or superior jurisdiction subordinate to another High Court.   147     (2) The Supreme Court may act under this section only on the application of the Attorney-General of India or  of a party interested, and every such application shall be made by motion, which shall, except when the applicant is  the Attorney-General of India or the Advocate-General of the State, be supported by affidavit or affirmation.  (3) Where  any  application  for  the  exercise  of  the  powers  conferred  by  this  section  is  dismissed,  the  Supreme  Court  may, if it  is of opinion  that  the  application  was frivolous or vexatious, order the  applicant to pay by  way of  compensation to any person who has opposed the application such sum not exceeding one thousand rupees as it may  consider appropriate in the circumstances of the case.  407.  Power  of  High  Court  to  transfer  cases  and  appeals.—(1) Whenever  it  is  made  to  appear  to  the  High  Court—  (a) that a fair and impartial inquiry or trial cannot be had in any Criminal Court subordinate thereto, or  (b) that some question of law of unusual difficulty is likely to arise, or  (c) that  an  order  under  this  section  is  required  by  any  provision  of  this  Code,  or  will  tend  to  the  general  convenience of the parties or witnesses, or is expedient for the ends of justice,  it may order—  (i) that  any  offence  be  inquired  into  or  tried  by  any  Court  not  qualified  under  sections  177  to  185  (both  inclusive), but in other respects competent to inquire into or try such offence;  (ii) that  any  particular  case  or  appeal,  or  class  of  cases  or  appeals,  be  transferred  from  a  Criminal  Court  subordinate to its authority to any other such Criminal Court of equal or superior jurisdiction;  (iii) that any particular case be committed for trial to a Court of Session; or  (iv) that any particular case or appeal be transferred to and tried before itself.  (2) The High Court may act either on the report of the lower Court, or on the application of a party interested, or  on its own initiative:  Provided  that  no  application  shall  lie  to  the  High  Court  for  transferring  a  case  from  one  Criminal  Court  to  another  Criminal  Court in the same  sessions division,  unless an application  for such  transfer  has been made  to the  Sessions Judge and rejected by him.  (3) Every application for an order under sub-section (1) shall be made by motion, which shall, except when the  applicant is the Advocate-General of the State, be supported by affidavit or affirmation.  (4) When  such  application  is  made  by  an  accused  person,  the  High  Court  may  direct  him  to  execute                     a  bond,  with  or  without  sureties,  for  the  payment  of  any  compensation  which  the  High  Court  may  award  under               sub-section (7).  (5) Every accused  person  making  such  application  shall  give  to  the  Public  Prosecutor  notice  in  writing  of  the  application, together with a copy of the grounds on which it is made; and no order shall be made on the merits of the  applications unless at least twenty-four hours have elapsed between the giving of such notice and the hearing of the  application.   (6) Where  the  application  is  for  the  transfer  of  a  case  or  appeal  from  any  Subordinate  Court,  the  High  Court  may,  if  it  is  satisfied  that  it  is  necessary  so  to  do in  the  interest  of  Justice,  order  that,  pending  the  disposal  of  the  application the proceedings in the Subordinate Court shall be stayed, on such terms as the High Court may think fit  to impose:  Provided that such stay shall not affect the Subordinate Court’s power of remand under section 309.   148     (7) Where an application for an order under sub-section (1) is dismissed, the High Court may, if it is of opinion  that  the  application  was  frivolous  or  vexatious,  order  the  applicant  to  pay  by  way  of  compensation  to any  person  who  has  opposed  the  application  such  sum  not  exceeding  one  thousand  rupees  as  it  may  consider  proper  in  the  circumstances of the case.  (8) When the High Court orders under sub-section (1) that a case be transferred from any Court for trial before  itself,  it  shall  observe  in  such  trial  the  same  procedure  which  that  Court  would  have  observed  if  the  case  had  not  been so transferred.  (9) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect any order of Government under section 197.  408.  Power  of  Sessions  Judge  to  transfer  cases  and  appeals.—(1) Whenever  it  is  made  to  appear  to  a  Sessions  Judge  that  an  order  under  this  sub-section  is  expedient  for  the  ends  of  justice,  he  may  order  that  any  particular case be transferred from one Criminal Court to another Criminal Court in his sessions division.   (2) The  Sessions  Judge  may  act  either  on  the  report  of  the  lower  Court,  or  on  the  application  of  a  party  interested, or on his own initiative.  (3) The  provisions  of  sub-sections (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) and (9) of  section  407  shall  apply  in  relation  to  an  application to the Sessions, Judge for an order under sub-section (1) as they apply in relation to an application to the  High Court for an order under sub-section (1) of section 407 except that sub-section (7) of that section shall so apply  as  if  for  the  words “one  thousand  rupees” occurring  therein,  the  words “two  hundred  and  fifty  rupees” were  substituted.  409. Withdrawal of cases and appeals by Session Judge.—(1) A Sessions Judge  may  withdraw any case  or  appeal from, or recall any case or appeal which he has made over to, any Assistant Sessions Judge or Chief Judicial  Magistrate subordinate to him.  (2) At any time before  the trial  of the  case  or the  hearing  of the appeal has commenced before  the  Additional  Sessions Judge, a Sessions Judge may recall any case or appeal which he has made over to any Additional Sessions  Judge.  (3) Where a Sessions Judge withdraws or recalls case or appeal under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), he may  either try the case in his own Court or hear the appeal himself, or make it over in accordance with the provisions of  this Code to another Court for trial or hearing, as the case may be.  410. Withdrawal of cases by Judicial Magistrate.—(1) Any Chief Judicial Magistrate may withdraw any case  from, or recall any case which he has made over to, any Magistrate subordinate to him, and may inquire into or try  such  case  himself,  or  refer  it  for  inquiry  or  trial  to  any  other  such  Magistrate  competent  to  inquire  into  or  try  the  same.  (2) Any Judicial Magistrate may recall any case made over by him under sub-section (2) of section 192 to any  other Magistrate and may inquire into or try such cases himself.  411.   Making   over   or   withdrawal   of   cases   by   Executive   Magistrates.—Any   District   Magistrate   or                    Sub- Divisional Magistrate may—  (a) make  over,  for  disposal,  any  proceeding  which  has  been  started  before  him,  to  any  Magistrate  subordinate to him;  (b) withdraw any case  from,  or recall any case  which he  has  made  over to, any Magistrate  subordinate  to  him, and dispose of such proceeding himself  or refer it for disposal to any other Magistrate.  412.  Reasons  to  be  recorded.—A  Sessions  Judge  or  Magistrate  making  an  order  under  section  408,  section  409, section 410 or section 411 shall record his reasons for making it.   149    CHAPTER XXXII  EXECUTION, SUSPENSION, REMISSION AND COMMUTATION OF SENTENCES  A.—Death Sentences  413.  Execution  of  order  passed  under  section  368.—When  in  a  case  submitted  to  the  High  Court  for  the  confirmation  of  a  sentence  of  death,  the  Court  of  Session  receives  the  order  of  confirmation  or  other  order  of  the  High Court thereon, it shall cause such order to be carried into effect by issuing a warrant or taking such other steps  as may be necessary.  414. Execution of sentence of death passed by High Court.—When a sentence of death is passed by the High  Court  in  appeal  or  in  revision,  the  Court  of  Session  shall,  on  receiving  the  order  of  the  High  Court,  cause  the  sentence to be carried into effect by issuing a warrant.  415.  Postponement  of  execution  of  sentence  of  death  in  case  of  appeal  to  Supreme  Court.—(1) Where  a  person is  sentenced  to  death  by  the  High  Court  and  an  appeal  from  its  judgment  lies  to  the  Supreme  Court  under  sub-clause (a) or  sub-clause (b) of  clause (1) of  article  134  of  the  Constitution,  the  High  Court  shall  order  the  execution of the sentence to be postponed until the period allowed for preferring such appeal has expired, or if, an  appeal is preferred within that period, until such appeal is disposed of.  (2) Where  a sentence  of  death  is  passed  or  confirmed  by  the  High  Court,  and  the  person  sentenced  makes  an  application to the High Court for the grant of a certificate under article 132 or under sub-clause (c) of clause (1) of  article 134 of the Constitution, the High Court shall order the execution of the  sentence to be postponed until such  application  is  disposed  of  by  the  High  Court,  or  if  a  certificate  is  granted  on  such  application,  until  the  period  allowed for preferring an appeal to the Supreme Court on such certificate has expired.  (3) Where a sentence of death is passed or confirmed by the High Court, and the High Court is satisfied that the  person  sentenced  intends  to  present  a  petition  to  the  Supreme  Court  for  the  grant  of  special  leave  to  appeal  under  article  136  of  the  Constitution,  the  High  Court  shall  order  the  execution  of  the  sentence  to  be  postponed  for  such  period as it considers sufficient to enable him to present such petition.  416. Postponement of capital sentence on pregnant woman.—If a woman sentenced to death is found to be  pregnant, the High Court shall  1 [****], commute the sentence to imprisonment for life.  B.—Imprisonment  417. Power to appoint place of imprisonment.—(1) Except when otherwise provided by any law for the time  being in force, the State Government may direct in  what place any person liable to be imprisoned or committed to  custody under this Code shall be confined.  (2) If any person liable  to be  imprisoned or committed to custody under this Code is in confinement in a civil  jail,  the Court  or  Magistrate  ordering  the  imprisonment  or  committal  may  direct  that  the  person  be  removed  to  a  criminal jail.   (3) When a person is removed to a criminal jail under sub-section (2), he shall, on being released therefrom, be  sent back to the civil jail, unless either—  (a) three years have elapsed since he was removed to the criminal jail, in which case he shall be deemed to  have  been  released  from  the  civil  jail  under  section  58  of  the  Code  of  Civil  Procedure,  1908  (5  of  1908),  or  section 23 of the Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920 (5 of 1920), as the case may be; or  (b) the  Court  which  ordered  his  imprisonment  in  the  civil  jail  has  certified  to  the  officer  in  charge  of  the  criminal jail that he is entitled to be released under section 58 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908),  or under section 23 of the Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920 (5 of 1920), as the case may be.                                                     1. Certain words omitted by Act 5 of 2009, s. 30 (w.e.f. 31-12-2009).   150    418. Execution of sentence of imprisonment.—(1) Where the accused is sentenced to imprisonment for life or  to  imprisonment  for a  term  in  cases  other  than  those  provided  for  by  section  413,  the  Court  passing  the  sentence  shall  forthwith  forward  a  warrant  to  the  jail  or  other  place  in  which  he  is,  or  is  to  be,  confined,  and,  unless  the  accused is already confined in such jail or other place, shall forward him to such jail or other place, with the warrant:  Provided  that  where  the  accused  is  sentenced  to  imprisonment  till  the  rising  of  the  Court,  it  shall  not  be  necessary to prepare or forward a warrant to a jail, and the accused may be confined in such place as the Court may  direct.  (2) Where  the  accused  is  not  present  in  Court  when  he  is  sentenced  to  such  imprisonment  as  is  mentioned  in  sub-section (1), the  Court shall issue  a  warrant  for his arrest for the  purpose  of forwarding  him to the  jail or other  place in which he is to be confined; and in such case, the sentence shall commence on the date of his arrest.  419.  Direction  of  warrant  for  execution.—Every  warrant  for  the  execution  of  a  sentence  of  imprisonment  shall be directed to the officer in charge of the jail or other place in which the prisoner is, or is to be, confined.  420.  Warrant  with  whom  to  be  lodged.—When  the  prisoner  is  to  be  confined  in  a  jail,  the  warrant  shall  be  lodged with the jailor.  C.—Levy of fine  421. Warrant for levy of fine.—(1) When an offender has been sentenced to pay a fine, the Court passing the  sentence may take action for the recovery of the fine in either or both of the following ways, that is to say, it may—  (a) issue a warrant for the levy of the amount by attachment and sale of any movable property belonging to  the offender;  (b) issue a  warrant to the  Collector of the district, authorising him to realise the amount as arrears of land  revenue from the movable or immovable property, or both, of the defaulter:  Provided that, if the sentence directs that in default of payment of the fine, the offender shall be imprisoned, and  if such offender has undergone the whole of such imprisonment in default, no Court shall issue such warrant unless,  for special reasons to be recorded in writing, it considers it necessary so to do, or unless  it has made an order for the  payment of expenses or compensation out of the fine under section 357.  (2) The State Government may make rules regulating the manner in which warrants under clause (a) of      sub- section (1) are to be executed, and for the summary determination of any claims made by any person other than the  offender in respect of any property attached in execution of such warrant.  (3) Where  the  Court  issues  a  warrant to  the  Collector  under  clause (b) of  sub-section (1),  the  Collector  shall  realise the amount in accordance with the law relating to recovery of arrears of land revenue, as if such warrant were  a certificate issued under such law:  Provided that no such warrant shall be executed by the arrest or detention in prison of the offender.  422. Effect of such warrant.—A warrant issued under clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 421 by any Court  may  be  executed  within  the  local  jurisdiction  of  such  Court,  and  it  shall  authorise  the  attachment  and  sale  of  any  such  property  outside  such  jurisdiction,  when  it  is  endorsed  by  the  District  Magistrate  within  whose  local  jurisdiction such property is found.  423.  Warrant  for  levy  of  fine  issued  by  a  Court  in  any  territory  to  which  this  Code  does  not  extend.— Notwithstanding anything contained in this Code or in any other law for the time being in force, when an offender  has  been  sentenced  to  pay  a  fine  by  a Criminal  Court  in  any  territory  to  which  this  Code  does  not  extend  and  the  Court passing the sentence issues a warrant to the Collector of a district in the territories to which this Code extends,  authorising him to realise the amount as if it were an arrear of land revenue, such warrant shall be deemed to be a  warrant  issued  under  clause (b) of  sub-section (1) of  section  421  by  a Court  in  the  territories  to  which  this  Code  extends,  and  the  provisions  of  sub-section (3) of  the  said  section  as  to  the  execution  of  such  warrant  shall  apply  accordingly.   151    424.  Suspension  of  execution  of  sentence  of  imprisonment.—(1) When  an  offender  has  been  sentenced  to  fine only and to imprisonment in default of payment of the fine, and the fine is not paid forthwith, the Court may—  (a) order that the fine shall be payable either in full on or before a date not more than thirty days from the  date of the order, or in two or three instalments, of which the first shall be payable on or before a date not more  than thirty days from the date of the order and the other or others at an interval or at intervals, as the case may  be, of not more than thirty days;  (b) suspend the execution of the sentence of imprisonment and release the offender, on the execution by the  offender of a  bond,  with or  without sureties,  as the  Court thinks  fit,  conditioned for  his appearance before  the  Court on the date or dates on or before which payment of the fine or the instalments thereof, as the case may be,  is to be made; and if the amount of the fine or of any instalment, as the case may be, is not realised on or before  the latest date on which it is payable under the order, the Court may direct the sentence of imprisonment to be  carried into execution at once.  (2) The provisions of sub-section (1) shall be applicable also in any case in which an order for the payment of  money  has  been  made  on  non-recovery  of  which  imprisonment  may  be  awarded  and  the  money  is  not  paid  forthwith; and, if the person against whom the order has been made, on being required to enter into a bond such as is  referred to in that sub-section, fails to do so, the Court may at once pass sentence of imprisonment.  D.—General provisions regarding execution  425.  Who  may  issue  warrant.—Every  warrant  for  the  execution  of  a  sentence  may  be  issued  either  by  the  Judge or Magistrate who passed the sentence, or by his successor-in-office.  426. Sentence on escaped convict when to take effect.—(1) When a sentence of death, imprisonment for life  or fine is passed under this Code on an escaped convict, such sentence shall, subject to the provisions hereinbefore  contained, take effect immediately.  (2) When a sentence of imprisonment for a term is passed under this Code on an escaped convict,—  (a) if  such  sentence  is  severer  in  kind  than  the  sentence  which  such  convict  was  undergoing  when  he  escaped, the new sentence shall take effect immediately;  (b) if such  sentence is not severer in  kind than the sentence  which such convict  was undergoing  when he  escaped, the new sentence shall take effect after he has suffered imprisonment for a further period equal to that  which, at the time of his escape, remained unexpired of his former sentence.  (3) For the  purposes of sub-section (2), a  sentence of rigorous imprisonment shall be deemed to be  severer in  kind than a sentence of simple imprisonment.  427. Sentence on offender already sentenced for another offence.—(1) When a person already undergoing a  sentence of imprisonment is sentenced on a subsequent conviction to imprisonment or imprisonment  for life,  such  imprisonment or imprisonment for life shall commence at the expiration of the imprisonment to which he has been  previously sentenced, unless the Court directs that the subsequent sentence shall run concurrently with such previous  sentence:  Provided that where a person who has been sentenced to imprisonment by an order under section 122 in default  of  furnishing  security  is,  whilst  undergoing  such  sentence,  sentenced  to  imprisonment  for  an  offence  committed  prior to the making of such order, the latter sentence shall commence immediately.  (2) When  a  person  already  undergoing  a  sentence of  imprisonment  for  life  is  sentenced  on  a  subsequent  conviction to imprisonment for a term or imprisonment for life, the subsequent sentence shall run concurrently with  such previous sentence.   152    428. Period of detention undergone by the accused to be set off against the sentence of imprisonment.—  Where an accused person has, on conviction, been sentenced to imprisonment for a term,  1 [not being imprisonment  in default of payment of fine], the period of detention, if any, undergone by him during the  investigation, inquiry or  trial  of  the  same  case  and  before  the  date  of  such  conviction,  shall  be  set  off  against  the  term  of  imprisonment  imposed  on  him  on  such  conviction,  and  the  liability  of  such  person  to  undergo  imprisonment  on  such  conviction  shall be restricted to the remainder, if any, of the term of imprisonment imposed on him:  2 [Provided that in cases referred to in section 433A, such period of detention shall be set off against the period  of fourteen years referred to in that section.]  429. Saving.—(1) Nothing in section 426 or section 427 shall be held to excuse any person from any part of the  punishment to which he is liable upon his former or subsequent conviction.  (2) When  an  award  of  imprisonment  in  default  of  payment  of  a  fine  is  annexed  to  a  substantive  sentence  of  imprisonment and the person undergoing the sentence is after its execution to undergo a further substantive sentence  or further substantive sentences of imprisonment, effect shall not be given to the award of imprisonment in default  of payment of the fine until the person has undergone the further sentence or sentences.  430.  Return  of  warrant  on  execution  of  sentence.—When  a  sentence  has  been  fully  executed,  the  officer  executing  it  shall  return  the  warrant  to  the  Court  from  which  it  is  issued,  with  an  endorsement  under  his  hand  certifying the manner in which the sentence has been executed.  431. Money ordered to be paid recoverable as a fine.—Any  money (other than a  fine) payable  by virtue  of  any order made under this Code, and the method of recovery of which is not otherwise expressly provided for, shall  be recoverable as if it were a fine:  Provided  that  section  421  shall,  in  its  application  to  an  order  under  section  359,  by  virtue  of  this  section,  be  construed as if in the proviso to sub-section (1) of section 421, after the words and figures \"under section 357\", the  words and figures \"or an order for payment of costs under section 359\" had been inserted.  E.—Suspension, remission and commutation of sentences  432.  Power  to  suspend  or  remit sentences.—(1) When  any  person  has  been  sentenced  to  punishment  for  an  offence, the appropriate Government may, at any time, without conditions or upon any conditions which the person  sentenced accepts, suspend the execution of his sentence or remit the whole or any part of the punishment to which  he has been sentenced.  (2) Whenever  an  application  is  made  to  the  appropriate  Government  for  the  suspension  or  remission  of  a  sentence,  the  appropriate  Government  may  require  the  presiding  Judge  of  the  Court  before  or  by  which  the  conviction  was  had  or  confirmed,  to  state  his  opinion  as  to  whether  the  application  should  be  granted  or  refused,  together with his reasons for such opinion and also to forward with the statement of such opinion a certified copy of  the record of the trial or of such record thereof as exists.  (3) If  any  condition  on  which  a  sentence  has  been  suspended  or  remitted  is,  in  the  opinion  of  the  appropriate  Government,  not fulfilled, the appropriate  Government  may cancel the  suspension or remission, and thereupon the  person  in  whose  favour  the  sentence  has  been  suspended  or  remitted  may,  if  at  large,  be  arrested  by  any  police  officer, without warrant and remanded to undergo the unexpired portion of the sentence.  (4) The condition on which a sentence is suspended or remitted under this section may be one to be fulfilled by  the person in whose favour the sentence is suspended or remitted, or one independent of his will.  (5) The appropriate Government may, by general rules or special orders, give directions as to the suspension of  sentences and the conditions on which petitions should be presented and dealt with:                                                    1. Ins. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 31  (w.e.f.18-12-1978).   2. Ins. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 34 (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).   153    Provided that in the case of any sentence (other than a sentence of fine) passed on a male person above the age  of eighteen years, no such petition by the person sentenced or by any other person on his behalf shall be entertained,  unless the person sentenced is in jail, and—  (a) where such petition is made by the person sentenced, it is presented through the officer in charge of the  jail; or  (b) where such petition is made by any other person, it contains a declaration that the person sentenced is in  jail.  (6) The provisions of the above sub-sections shall also apply to any order passed by a Criminal Court under any  section of this Code or of any other law, which restricts the liberty of any person or imposes any liability upon him  or his property.  (7) In this section and in section 433, the expression \"appropriate Government\" means,—  (a) in cases where the sentence is for an offence against, or the order referred to in sub-section (6) is passed  under, any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, the Central Government;  (b) in other cases, the Government of the State within which the offender is sentenced or the said order is  passed.  433.  Power  to  commute  sentence.—The  appropriate  Government  may,  without  the  consent  of  the  person  sentenced, commute—  (a) a sentence of death, for any other punishment provided by the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860);  (b) a  sentence  of  imprisonment  for  life,  for  imprisonment  for  a  term  not  exceeding  fourteen  years  or  for  fine;  (c) a sentence of rigorous imprisonment, for simple imprisonment for any term to which that person might  have been sentenced, or for fine;  (d) a sentence of simple imprisonment, for fine.  1 [433A.  Restriction  on  powers  of  remission  or  commutation  in  certain  cases.—Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  section  432,  where  a  sentence  of  imprisonment  for  life  is  imposed  on  conviction  of  a  person  for  an  offence  for  which  death  is  one  of  the  punishments  provided  by  law,  or  where  a  sentence  of  death  imposed  on  a  person  has  been  commuted  under  section  433  into  one  of  imprisonment  for  life,  such  person  shall  not  be  released  from prison unless he had served at least fourteen years of imprisonment.]  434.  Concurrent  power  of  Central  Government  in  case  of  death  sentences.—The  powers  conferred  by  sections  432  and  433  upon  the  State  Government  may,  in  the  case  of  sentences  of  death,  also  be  exercised  by  the  Central Government.  435.  State  Government  to  act  after consultation  with  Central  Government  in  certain  cases.—(1) The  powers conferred by sections 432 and 433 upon the State Government to remit or commute a sentence, in any case  where the sentence is for an offence—  (a) which  was investigated by the  Delhi Special Police  Establishment constituted  under the Delhi Special  Police Establishment Act, 1946 (25 of 1946), or by any other agency empowered to make investigation into an  offence under any Central Act other than this Code, or  (b) which  involved  the  misappropriation  or  destruction  of,  or  damage  to,  any  property  belonging  to  the  Central Government, or                                                    1. Ins. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 32   (w.e.f.18-12-1978).      154    (c) which was committed by a person in the service of the Central Government while acting or purporting  to act in the discharge of his official duty,  shall not be exercised by the State Government except after consultation with the Central Government.  (2) No order of suspension, remission or commutation of sentences passed by the State Government in relation  to a  person, who has been convicted of offences, some  of  which relate to  matters to  which the  executive  power of  the  Union  extends,  and  who  has  been  sentenced  to  separate  terms  of  imprisonment  which  are  to  run  concurrently,  shall  have  effect  unless  an  order  for  the  suspension,  remission  or  commutation,  as  the  case  may  be,  of  such  sentences has also been made by the Central Government in relation to the offences committed by such person with  regard to matters to which the executive power of the Union extends.  CHAPTER XXXIII  PROVISIONS AS TO BAIL AND BONDS  436.  In  what  cases  bail  to  be  taken.—(1) When  any  person  other  than  a person  accused  of  a  non-bailable  offence is arrested or detained  without  warrant by an officer in charge  of a  police  station, or appears or is brought  before  a  Court, and  is  prepared  at  any  time  while  in  the  custody  of  such  officer  or  at  any  stage  of  the  proceeding  before such Court to give bail, such person shall be released on bail:  Provided  that  such  officer  or  Court,  if  he  or  it  thinks  fit,  1 [may,  and  shall,  if  such  person  is  indigent  and  is  unable  to  furnish  surety,  instead  of  taking  bail] from  such  person,  discharge  him  on  his  executing  a  bond  without  sureties for his appearance as hereinafter provided.  2 [Explanation.—Where  a  person  is  unable  to  give  bail  within  a week  of  the  date  of  his  arrest,  it  shall  be  a  sufficient  ground  for  the  officer  or  the  Court  to  presume  that  he  is  an  indigent  person  for  the  purposes  of  this  proviso:]  Provided  further  that  nothing  in  this  section  shall  be  deemed  to  affect  the  provisions of  sub-section (3) of  section 116  3 [or section 446A].  (2) Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  sub-section (1), where  a  person  has  failed  to  comply  with  the  conditions of the bail-bond as regards the time and place of attendance, the Court may refuse to release him on bail,  when on a subsequent occasion in the same case he appears before the Court or is brought in custody and any such  refusal shall be without prejudice to the powers of the Court to call upon any person bound by such bond to pay the  penalty thereof under section 446.  4 [436A. Maximum period for which an undertrial prisoner can be detained.—Where a person has, during  the  period  of  investigation,  inquiry  or  trial  under  this  Code  of  an  offence  under  any  law  (not  being  an  offence  for  which the punishment of death has been specified as one of the punishments under that law) undergone detention for  a period extending up to one-half of the maximum period of imprisonment specified for that offence under that law,  he shall be released by the Court on his personal bond with or without sureties:  Provided that the Court may, after hearing the Public Prosecutor and for reasons to be recorded by it in writing,  order the continued detention of such person for a period longer than one-half of the said period or release him on  bail instead of the personal bond with or without sureties:  Provided further that no such person shall in any case be detained during the period of investigation, inquiry or  trial for more than the maximum period of imprisonment provided for the said offence under that law.  Explanation.—In computing the period of detention under this section for granting bail, the period of detention  passed due to delay in proceeding caused by the accused shall be excluded.]                                                    1.

(6) If,  in  any  case  triable  by  a  Magistrate,  the  trial  of  a  person  accused  of  any  non-bailable  offence  is  not  concluded within a period of sixty days from the first date fixed for taking evidence in the case, such person shall, if  he is in custody during the whole of the said period, be released on bail to the satisfaction of the Magistrate, unless  for reasons to be recorded in writing, the Magistrate otherwise directs.  (7) If,  at  any  time,  after  the  conclusion  of  the  trial  of  a  person  accused  of  a  non-bailable  offence  and  before  judgment is delivered, the Court is of opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not  guilty of any such offence, it shall release the accused, if he is in custody, on the execution by him of a bond without  sureties for his appearance to hear judgment delivered.   2 [437A. Bail to require  accused to appear  before next appellate  Court.—(1) Before  conclusion of  the  trial  and  before  disposal  of  the  appeal,  the  Court  trying  the  offence  or  the  Appellate  Court,  as  the  case  may  be,  shall   require  the  accused to execute  bail bonds  with sureties,  to  appear before  the  higher  Court as and  when such  Court  issues  notice  in  respect  of  any  appeal  or  petition  filed  against  the  judgment of  the  respective  Court  and  such  bail  bonds shall be in force for six months.  (2) If such accused fails to appear, the bond stand forfeited and the procedure under section 446 shall apply.]   438. Direction for grant of bail to person apprehending arrest.—(1) When any person has reason to believe  that  he  may  be  arrested  on  an  accusation  of  having  committed  a  non-bailable  offence,  he  may  apply  to  the  High  Court or the Court of Session for a direction under this section; and that Court may, if it thinks fit, direct that in the  event of such arrest, he shall be released on bail.  (2) When the High Court or the Court of Session makes a direction under sub-section (1), it may include such  conditions in such directions in the light of the facts of the particular case, as it may think fit, including—  (i) a condition that the person shall make himself available for interrogation by a police officer as and when  required;  (ii) a condition that the person shall not, directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to  any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court or  to any police officer;  (iii) a condition that the person shall not leave India without the previous permission of the Court;  (iv) such  other  condition  as  may  be  imposed  under  sub-section (3) of  section  437,  as  if  the  bail  were  granted under that section.   (3)  If  such  person  is  thereafter  arrested  without  warrant  by  an  officer  in  charge  of  a  police  station  on  such  accusation, and is prepared either at the time of arrest or at any time while in the custody of such officer to give bail,  he shall be released on bail; and if a Magistrate taking cognizance of such offence decides that a warrant should be  issued in the first instance against that person, he shall issue a bailable warrant in confirmity with the direction of the  Court under sub-section (1).                                                    1. Subs. by Act  63 of 1980, s. 5,   for “reasons”  (w.e.f. 23-9-1980).   2. Ins. by Act 5 of 2009, s. 31 (w.e.f. 31-12-2009)    157    439.  Special  powers  of  High  Court  or  Court  of  Session  regarding  bail.—(1) A  High  Court  or  Court  of  Session may direct,—  (a) that  any  person accused  of  an  offence  and  in  custody  be  released  on  bail,  and  if  the  offence  is  of  the  nature  specified in sub-section (3) of  section 437, may impose any condition which it considers necessary for  the purposes mentioned in that sub-section;  (b) that any condition imposed by a Magistrate when releasing any person on bail be set aside or modified:   Provided that the High Court or the Court of Session shall, before granting bail to a person who is accused of an  offence  which  is  triable  exclusively  by  the  Court  of  Session  or  which,  though  not  so  triable,  is  punishable  with  imprisonment  for life,  give  notice  of the  application  for bail to the  Public Prosecutor unless it is, for reasons to be  recorded in writing, of opinion that it is not practicable to give such notice.  (2) A  High  Court  or  Court  of  Session  may  direct  that  any  person  who  has  been  released  on  bail  under  this  Chapter be arrested and commit him to custody.  440.  Amount  of  bond  and  reduction  thereof.—(1) The  amount  of  every  bond  executed  under  this  Chapter  shall be fixed with due regard to the circumstances of the case and shall not be excessive.  (2) The High Court or the Court of Session may direct that the bail required by a police officer or Magistrate be  reduced.  441. Bond of accused and sureties.—(1) Before any person is released on bail or released on his own bond, a  bond for such sum of money as the police officer or Court, as the case may be, thinks sufficient shall be executed by  such person, and, when he is released on bail, by one or more sufficient sureties conditioned that such person shall  attend at  the time  and place  mentioned in the  bond, and shall continue so to attend  until otherwise  directed by the  police officer or Court, as the case may be.  (2) Where  any  condition  is  imposed  for  the  release  of  any  person  on  bail,  the  bond  shall  also  contain  that  condition.  (3) If the case so requires, the bond shall also bind the person released on bail to appear when called upon at the  High Court, Court of Session or other Court to answer the charge.  (4) For the purpose of determining whether the  sureties are fit or sufficient, the Court may accept affidavits in  proof of the facts contained therein relating to the sufficiency or fitness of the sureties, or, if it considers necessary,  may either hold an enquiry itself or cause an inquiry to be made by a Magistrate subordinate to the Court, as to such  sufficiency or fitness.  1 [441A.  Declaration  by  sureties.—Every  person  standing  surety  to  an  accused  person  for  his  release  on  bail,  shall  make  a  declaration before  the  Court  as  to  the  number  of  persons  to  whom  he  has  stood  surety  including  the  accused, giving therein all the relevant particulars.]  442. Discharge from custody.—(1) As soon as the bond has been executed, the person for whose appearance it  has been executed shall be  released; and,  when  he  is in jail, the  court admitting him to bail shall issue  an order of  release to the officer in charge of the jail, and such officer on receipt of the orders shall release him.  (2) Nothing  in  this  section,  section 436  or  section  437,  shall  be  deemed  to  require  the  release  of  any  person  liable to be detained for some matter other than that in respect of which the bond was executed.                                                    1. Ins. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 39 (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).   158    443.  Power  to  order  sufficient  bail  when  that  first  taken  is  insufficient.—If,  through mistake,  fraud  or  otherwise, insufficient sureties have been accepted, or if they afterwards become insufficient, the Court may issue a  warrant of arrest directing that the person released on bail be brought before it and may order him to find sufficient  sureties, and, on his failing so to do, may commit him to jail.  444. Discharge of sureties.—(1) All or any sureties for the attendance and appearance of a person released on  bail may at any time apply to a Magistrate to discharge the bond, either wholly or so far as relates to the applicants.  (2) On such application being made, the Magistrate shall issue his warrant of arrest directing that the person so  released be brought before him.  (3) On the appearance of such person pursuant to the warrant, or on his voluntary surrender, the Magistrate shall  direct the bond to be discharged either wholly or so far as relates to the applicants, and shall call upon such person to  find other sufficient sureties, and, if he fails to do so, may commit him to jail.  445. Deposit instead of recognizance.—When any person is required by any Court or officer to execute a bond  with or without sureties, such Court or officer may, except in the case of a bond for good behaviour, permit him to  deposit a sum of money or Government promissory notes to such amount as the Court or officer may fix  in lieu of  executing such bond.  446. Procedure when bond has been forfeited.—(1) Where a bond under this Code is for appearance, or for  production of property, before a Court and it is proved to the satisfaction of that Court, or of any Court to which the  case has subsequently been transferred, that the bond has been forfeited,   or where, in respect of any other bond under this Code, it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court by which the  bond was  taken,  or  of  any  Court  to  which  the  case  has  subsequently  been  transferred,  or  of  the  Court  of  any  Magistrate of the first class, that the bond has been forfeited,  the Court shall record the grounds of such proof, and may call upon any person bound by such bond to pay the  penalty thereof or to show cause why it should not be paid.  Explanation.—A  condition  in  a  bond  for  appearance,  or  for  production  of  property,  before  a  Court  shall  be  construed  as  including  a  condition  for  appearance,  or  as  the  case  may be,  for  production  of  property,  before  any  Court to which the case may subsequently be transferred.  (2) If sufficient cause is not shown and the penalty is not paid, the Court may proceed to recover the same as if  such penalty were a fine imposed by it under this Code:  1 [Provided that  where such penalty is not paid and cannot be recovered in the  manner aforesaid, the person so  bound as surety shall be liable, by order of the Court ordering the recovery of the penalty, to imprisonment in civil  jail for a term which may extend to six months.]   (3) The  Court may,  2 [after recording its reasons  for doing so], remit any portion of the  penalty  mentioned and  enforce payment in part only.  (4) Where a surety to a bond dies before the bond is forfeited, his estate shall be discharged from all liability in  respect of the bond.  (5) Where any person who has furnished security under section 106 or section 117 or section 360 is convicted  of an offence the commission of which constitutes a breach of the conditions of his bond, or of a bond executed in  lieu of his bond under section 448, a certified copy of the judgment of the Court by which he was convicted of such  offence  may  be  used  as  evidence  in  proceedings  under  this  section  against  his  surety  or  sureties,  and,  if  such  certified  copy  is  so  used,  the  Court  shall  presume  that  such  offence  was  committed  by  him  unless  the  contrary  is  proved.                                                    1. Added by Act 63 of 1980, s. 6 (w.e.f. 23-9-1980).   2. Subs. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 40, for “at its discretion” (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).   159    1 [446A.  Cancellation  of  bond  and  bail  bond.—Without  prejudice  to  the  provisions  of  section  446,  where  a  bond under this Code is for appearance of a person in a case and it is forfeited for breach of a condition,—  (a) the bond executed by such person as well as the bond, if any, executed by one or more of his sureties in  that case shall stand cancelled; and  (b) thereafter no such person shall be released only on his own bond in that case, if the Police Officer or the  Court,  as the  case  may be, for appearance before  whom the  bond was executed, is  satisfied that  there  was  no  sufficient cause for the failure of the person bound by the bond to comply with its condition:  Provided that subject to any other provisions of this Code he may be released in that case upon the execution of  a fresh personal bond for such sum of money and bond by one or more of such sureties as the Police Officer or the  Court, as the case may be, thinks sufficient.]  447. Procedure in case of insolvency of death of surety or when a bond is forfeited.—When any surety to a  bond under this Code becomes insolvent or dies, or when any bond is forfeited under the provisions of   section 446,  the Court by whose order such bond was taken, or a Magistrate of the first class may order the person from whom  such security was demanded to furnish fresh securities in accordance with the directions of the original order, and if  such  security is  not  furnished,  such  Court  or  Magistrate  may  proceed  as  if  there  had  been  a  default  in  complying  with such original order.  448. Bond required from minor.—When the person required by any Court, or officer to execute a bond is a  minor, such Court or officer may accept, in lieu thereof, a bond executed by a surety or sureties only.  449. Appeal from orders under section 446.—All orders passed under section 446 shall be appealable,—  (i) in the case of an order made by a Magistrate, to the Sessions Judge;  (ii) in the case of an order made by a Court of Session, to the Court to which an appeal lies from an order  made by such Court.  450.  Power  to  direct  levy of  amount  due  on  certain  recognizances.—The  High  Court  or  Court  of  Sessions  may  direct  any  Magistrate  to  levy  the  amount  due  on  a  bond  for  appearance  or  attendance  at  such  High  Court  or  Court of Session.  CHAPTER XXXIV  DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY  451.  Order  for  custody  and  disposal  of  property  pending  trial  in  certain  cases.—When  any  property  is  produced before  any Criminal Court during any inquiry or trial, the  Court  may  make  such order as it thinks fit  for  the proper custody of such property pending the conclusion of the inquiry or trial, and, if the property is subject to  speedy and natural decay, or if it is otherwise expedient so to do, the Court may, after recording such evidence as it  thinks necessary, order it to be sold or otherwise disposed of.  Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, \"property\" includes—  (a) property of any kind or document which is produced before the Court or which is in its custody;  (b) any  property  regarding  which  an  offence  appears  to  have  been  committed  or  which  appears  to  have  been used for the commission of any offence.  452.  Order  for  disposal  of  property  at  conclusion  of  trial.—(1) When  an  inquiry  or  trial  in  any  Criminal  Court is concluded, the  Court  may  make  such order as it thinks  fit for the  disposal, by destruction, confiscation or  delivery  to  any  person  claiming  to  be  entitled  to  possession  thereof  or  otherwise,  of  any  property  or  document  produced before it or in its custody, or regarding which any offence appears to have been committed, or which has  been used for the commission of any offence.                                                    1. Ins. by Act 63 of 1980, s. 7 (w.e.f. 23-9-1980).      160    (2) An order may be  made under sub-section (1) for the delivery of any property to any person claiming to be  entitled  to  the  possession  thereof,  without  any  condition  or  on  condition  that  he  executes  a  bond,  with  or  without  securities,  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Court,  engaging  to  restore  such  property  to  the  Court  if  the  order  made  under  sub-section (1) is modified or set aside on appeal or revision.  (3) A  Court  of  Session  may,  instead  of  itself  making  an  order  under  sub-section (1), direct  the  property  to  be  delivered to the Chief Judicial Magistrate, who shall thereupon deal with it in the manner provided in sections 457,  458 and 459.  (4) Except where the property is livestock or is subject to speedy and natural decay, or where a bond has been  executed  in  pursuance  of  sub-section (2), an  order  made  under  sub-section (1) shall  not  be carried  out  for  two  months, or when an appeal is presented, until such appeal has been disposed of.  (5) In this section, the  term \"property\" includes, in the case of property regarding which an offence appears to  have  been  committed,  not  only  such  property as  has  been  originally  in  the  possession  or  under  the  control  of  any  party,  but  also  any  property  into  or  for  which  the  same  may  have been  converted  or  exchanged,  and  anything  acquired by such conversion or exchange, whether immediately or otherwise.  453. Payment  to  innocent  purchaser  of  money  found  on  accused.—When  any  person  is  convicted  of  any  offence  which  includes,  or  amounts  to,  theft  or  receiving  stolen  property,  and  it  is  proved  that any  other  person  bought  the  stolen  property  from  him  without  knowing    or having  reason  to  believe    that  the  same  was  stolen,  and  that  any  money  has  on  his  arrest  been  taken  out  of  the  possession  of the  convicted  person,  the  Court  may,  on  the  application  of  such  purchaser  and  on  the  restitution  of  the  stolen  property  to the  person entitled  to  the  possession  thereof, order that out of such money a sum not exceeding the price paid by such purchaser be delivered to him.  454. Appeal against orders under  section 452 or section 453.—(1) Any person aggrieved by an order made  by a Court under section 452 or section 453, may appeal against it to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from  convictions by the former Court.  (2) On  such  appeal,  the  Appellate  Court  may  direct  the  order  to  be  stayed  pending  disposal  of  the  appeal,  or  may modify, alter or annul the order and make any further orders that may be just.  (3) The  powers  referred  to  in  sub-section (2) may  also  be  exercised  by  a  Court  of  appeal,  confirmation  or  revision while dealing with the case in which the order referred to in sub-section (1) was made.  455. Destruction of libellous and other matter.—(1) On a conviction under section 292, section 293, section  501 or section 502 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), the Court may order the destruction of all the copies of the  thing  in    respect  of  which  the  conviction  was  had,  and  which  are in  the  custody  of  the  Court  or  remain  in  the  possession or power of the person convicted.  (2) The Court may, in like manner, on a conviction under section 272, section 273, section 274 or section 275 of  the  Indian  Penal  Code  (45  of  1860),  order  the  food,  drink,  drug  or  medical  preparation  in  respect  of  which  the  conviction was had, to be destroyed.  456.  Power  to  restore  possession  of  immovable  property.—(1) When  a  person  is  convicted  of  an  offence  attended  by  criminal  force  or  show  of  force  or  by  criminal  intimidation,  and  it  appears  to  the  Court  that,  by  such  force or show of force or intimidation, any person has been dispossessed of any immovable property, the Court may,  if it thinks fit, order that possession of the same be restored to that person after evicting by force, if necessary, any  other person who may be in possession of the property:  Provided that no such order shall be made by the Court more than one month after the date of the conviction.  (2) Where  the  Court  trying  the  offence  has  not  made  an  order  under  sub-section (1), the  Court  of  appeal,  confirmation or revision may, if it thinks fit, make such order while disposing of the appeal, reference or revision, as  the case may be.  (3) Where  an  order  has  been made  under  sub-section (1), the  provisions  of  section  454 shall  apply  in  relation  thereto as they apply in relation to an order under section 453.  (4) No  order  made  under    this  section  shall  prejudice  any  right  or  interest  to  or  in such  immovable  property  which any person may be able to establish in a civil suit.   161    457.  Procedure  by  police  upon  seizure  of  property.—(1) Whenever  the  seizure  of  property  by  any  police  officer  is  reported  to  a  Magistrate  under  the  provisions  of  this  Code, and  such  property  is  not  produced  before  a  Criminal Court during an inquiry or trial, the Magistrate may make such order as he thinks fit respecting the disposal  of such property or the  delivery of  such property to the  person entitled to the  possession  thereof, or if such person  cannot be ascertained, respecting the custody and production of such property.  (2) If  the  person  so  entitled  is  known,  the  Magistrate  may  order  the  property  to  be  delivered  to  him  on  such  conditions (if any) as the Magistrate thinks fit and if such person is unknown, the Magistrate may detain it and shall,  in such case, issue a proclamation specifying the articles of which such property consists, and requiring any person  who may have a claim thereto, to appear before him and establish his claim within six months from the date of such  proclamation.  458.  Procedure  when no  claimant  appears  within  six  months.—(1) If  no  person  within  such  period  establishes his claim to such  property, and if the  person in  whose  possession such property  was found is unable  to  show  that  it  was  legally  acquired  by  him,  the  Magistrate  may    by  order direct  that  such  property  shall  be  at  the  disposal of the State Government  and may be sold by that Government and the proceeds of such sale shall be dealt  with in such manner as may be prescribed.  (2) An appeal shall lie against any such order to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from convictions by  the Magistrate.  459. Power to sell perishable property.—If the person entitled to the possession of such property is unknown  or absent and the property is subject to speedy and natural decay, or if the Magistrate to whom its seizure is reported  is of opinion that its sale would be for the benefit of the owner, or that the value of such property is  1 [less than five  hundred rupees],  the  Magistrate  may  at  any  time  direct  it  to  be  sold;  and  the  provisions  of  sections  457  and  458  shall, as nearly as may be practicable, apply to the net proceeds of such sale.  CHAPTER XXXV  IRREGULAR PROCEEDINGS  460. Irregularities which do not vitiate proceedings.—If any Magistrate not empowered by law to do any of  the following things, namely:—  (a) to issue a search-warrant under section 94;  (b) to order, under section 155, the police to investigate an offence;  (c) to hold an inquest under section 176;  (d) to  issue  process  under  section  187,  for  the  apprehension  of  a  person  within  his  local  jurisdiction  who  has committed an offence outside the limits of such jurisdiction;  (e) to take cognizance of an offence under clause (a) or clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 190;  (f) to make over a case under sub-section (2) of section 192;  (g) to tender a pardon under section 306;  (h) to recall a case and try it himself under section 410; or  (i) to sell property under section 458 or section 459,   erroneously  in  good  faith  does  that  thing,  his  proceedings  shall  not  be  set  aside  merely  on  the  ground  of  his  not  being so empowered.  461. Irregularities which vitiate proceedings.—If any Magistrate, not being empowered by law in this behalf,  does any of the following things, namely:—  (a) attaches and sells property under section 83;                                                    1. Subs. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 41, for “less than ten rupees” (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).   162    (b) issues  a  search-warrant  for  a  document,  parcel  or  other  things  in  the  custody  of  a  postal  or  telegraph  authority;  (c) demands security to keep the peace;  (d) demands security for good behaviour;  (e) discharges a person lawfully bound to be of good behaviour;  (f) cancels a bond to keep the peace;   (g) makes an order for maintenance;  (h) makes an order under section 133 as to a local nuisance;  (i) prohibits, under section 143, the repetition or continuance of a public nuisance;  (j) makes an order under Part C or Part D of Chapter X;  (k) takes cognizance of an offence under clause (c) of sub-section (1) of section 190;  (l) tries an offender;  (m) tries an offender summarily;  (n) passes a sentence, under section 325, on proceedings recorded by another Magistrate;  (o) decides an appeal;  (p) calls, under section 397, for proceedings; or   (q) revises an order passed under section 446,   his proceedings shall be void.  462.  Proceedings in  wrong  place.—No  finding,  sentence  or  order  of  any  Criminal  Court  shall  be  set  aside  merely on the ground that the inquiry, trial or other proceedings in the course of which it was arrived at or passed,  took place in a wrong sessions division, district, sub-division or other local area, unless it appears that such error has  in fact occasioned a failure of justice.   463.  Non-compliance  with  provisions  of  section  164  or  section  281.—(1) If  any  Court  before  which  a  confession  or  other  statement  of  an  accused person  recorded,  or  purporting  to  be  recorded  under  section  164  or  section 281, is tendered, or has been received, in evidence finds that any of the provisions of either of such sections  have not been complied with by the Magistrate recording the statement, it may, notwithstanding anything contained  in  section  91  of  the  Indian  Evidence  Act,  1872  (1  of  1872),  take  evidence  in  regard  to  such  non-compliance,  and  may, if satisfied that such non-compliance has not injured the accused in his defence on the merits and that he duly  made the statement recorded, admit such statement.  (2) The provisions of this section apply to Courts of appeal, reference and revision.  464. Effect of omission to frame, or absence of, or error in, charge.—(1) No finding, sentence or order by a  Court of competent jurisdiction shall be deemed invalid merely on the ground that no charge was framed or on the  ground  of  any  error,  omission  or  irregularity  in  the  charge  including  any  misjoinder  of  charges,  unless,  in  the  opinion of the Court of appeal, confirmation or revision, a failure of justice has in fact been occasioned thereby.  (2) If  the  Court  of  appeal,  confirmation  or  revision,  is  of  opinion  that  a  failure  of  justice  has  in  fact  been  occasioned, it may,—  (a) in  the  case  of  an  omission to  frame  a  charge,  order  that  a  charge  be  framed,  and  that  the  trial  be  recommended from the point immediately after the framing of the charge;  (b) in the case of an error, omission or irregularity in the charge, direct a new trial to be had upon a charge  framed in whatever manner it thinks fit:   163    Provided that if the Court is of opinion that the facts of the case are such that no valid charge could be preferred  against the accused in respect of the facts proved, it shall quash the conviction.  465.

Illustration  A  intentionally  causes  Z's  death,  partly  by  illegally  omitting  to  give  Z  food,  and  party  by  beating Z.  A  has  committed  murder.  37.  Co-operation  by  doing  one  of  several acts  constituting  an  offence.—When  an  offence  is  committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally co-operates in the commission of that offence  by doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence.  Illustrations  (a) A and B agree to murder Z by severally and at different times giving him small doses of poison. A and B administer the  poison according to the agreement with intent to murder Z. Z dies from the effects the several doses of poison so administered to  him. Here A and B intentionally cooperate in the commission of murder and as each of them does an act by  which the death is  caused, they are both guilty of the offence though their acts are separate.  (b)  A  and  B  are  joint  jailors,  and  as  such  have  the  charge  of  Z,  a  prisoner,  alternatively  for  six  hours  at  a  time.  A  and  B,  intending  to  cause  Z's  death,  knowingly  co-operate  in  causing  that  effect  by  illegally  omitting,  each  during  the  time  of  his  attendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose. Z dies of hunger. Both A and B are guilty of the murder of  Z.  (c)  A,  a  jailor,  has  the  charge  of  Z,  a  prisoner.  A,  intending  to  cause  Z's  death,  illegally  omits  to  supply  Z  with  food;  in  consequence of which Z is much reduced in strength, but the starvation is not sufficient to cause his death. A is dismissed from  his office, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or co-operation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that  he is likely thereby to cause Z's death. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of  murder, but, as A did not co-operate with B. A is guilty  only of an attempt to commit murder.  38.  Persons  concerned  in  criminal act  may  be guilty  of  different  offences.—Where  several  persons  are  engaged  or  concerned  in  the  commission  of  a  criminal  act,  they  may  be  guilty  of  different  offences by means of that act.  Illustration  A  attacks  Z  under  such  circumstances  of  grave  provocation  that  his  killing  of  Z  would be  only  culpable  homicide  not  amounting  to  murder.  B,  having  ill-will  towards  Z  and  intending  to  kill  him,  and  not  having  been  subject  to  the  provocation,  assists A in killing Z. Here, though A and B are both engaged in causing Z's death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of  culpable homicide.                                                              1. Subs. by Act 27 of 1870, s. 1, for section 34.   20    39. “Voluntarily”.—A  person  is  said  to  cause  an  effect “voluntarily” when  he  causes  it  by  means  whereby he intended to cause it, or by means  which, at the time  of employing those means, he  knew or  had reason to believe to be likely to cause it.  Illustration  A sets fire, by night, to an inhabited house in a large town, for the purpose of facilitating a robbery and thus causes the death  of a person. Here, A may not have intended to cause death; and may even be sorry that death has been caused by his act; yet, if he  knew that he was likely to cause death, he has caused death voluntarily.  1 [40. “Offence”.—Except in the  2 [Chapters] and sections mentioned in clauses 2 and 3 of this section,  the word “offence” denotes a thing made punishable by this Code.

Imprisonment  to terminate  on  payment  of  fine.—The  imprisonment  which  is  imposed  in  default of payment of a fine shall terminate whenever that fine is either paid or levied by process of law.  69.  Termination  of  imprisonment  on  payment of  proportional  part  of  fine.—If,  before  the  expiration of the term of imprisonment fixed in default of payment, such a proportion of the fine be paid  or levied that the term of imprisonment suffered in default of payment is not less than proportional to the  part of the fine still unpaid, the imprisonment shall terminate.  Illustration  A is sentenced to a fine of one hundred rupees and to four months' imprisonment in default of payment. Here, if seventy-five  rupees of the fine be paid or levied before the expiration of one month of the imprisonment, A will be discharged as soon as the  first  month  has  expired.

Limit  of  punishment  of  offence made  up  of  several  offences.—Where  anything  which  is  an  offence is made up of parts, any of which parts is itself an offence, the offender shall not be punished with  the punishment of more than one of such his offences, unless it be so expressly provided.  2 [Where anything is an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law in force for  the time being by which offences are defined or punished, or  where  several  acts,  of  which  one  or  more  than  one  would  by  itself  or  themselves  constitute  an  offence, constitute, when combined, a different offence,  the  offender  shall  not  be  punished  with  a  more  severe  punishment  than  the  Court  which  tries  him  could award for any one of such offences].  Illustrations  (a)  A  gives  Z  fifty  strokes  with  a  stick.  Here  A  may  have  committed  the  offence  of  voluntarily  causing  hurt  to  Z by  the  whole beating, and also by each of the blows which make up the whole beating. If A were liable to punishment for every blow,  he might be imprisoned for fifty years, one for each blow. But he is liable only to one punishment for the whole beating.  (b) But, if, while A is beating Z, Y interferes, and A intentionally strikes Y, here, as the blow given to Y is no part of the act  whereby  A  voluntarily  causes  hurt  to  Z,  A  is  liable  to one  punishment  for  voluntarily  causing  hurt  to  Z,  and to  another  for  the  blow given to Y.  72.  Punishment  of  person  guilty  of  one  of  several  offences,  the  judgment  stating  that  it  is  doubtful  of which.—In  all  cases  in  which  judgment  is  given  that  a  person  is  guilty  of  one  of  several  offences  specified  in  the  judgment,  but  that it  is  doubtful  of  which  of  these  offences  he  is  guilty,  the  offender  shall  be  punished  for  the  offence  for  which  the  lowest  punishment  is  provided  if  the  same  punishment is not provided for all.                                                              1. Ins. by Act 8 of 1882, s. 3.  2. Added by s. 4, ibid.   24    73.  Solitary  confinement.—Whenever  any  person  is  convicted  of an  offence  for  which  under  this  Code  the  Court  has  power  to  sentence  him  to  rigorous  imprisonment,  the  Court  may,  by  its  sentence,  order  that  the  offender  shall  be  kept  in  solitary  confinement  for  any  portion  or  portions  of  the  imprisonment  to  which  he  is sentenced,  not  exceeding  three  months  in  the  whole,  according  to  the  following scale, that is to say—  a time not exceeding one month if the term of imprisonment shall not exceed six months;  a time not exceeding two months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed six months and 1 [shall not  exceed one] year  a time not exceeding three months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed one year.  74. Limit   of   solitary   confinement.—In   executing   a   sentence   of   solitary   confinement,   such  confinement shall in no case exceed fourteen days at a time, with intervals between the periods of solitary  confinement  of  not  less  duration  than  such  periods;  and  when  the  imprisonment  awarded  shall  exceed  three  months,  the  solitary  confinement  shall  not  exceed  seven  days  in  any  one  month  of  the  whole  imprisonment  awarded,  with  intervals  between  the  periods  of  solitary  confinement  of  not  less  duration  than such periods.  2 [75.  Enhanced  punishment  for  certain  offences  under  Chapter  XII  or  Chapter  XVII  after  previous conviction.—Whoever, having been convicted,—  (a)  by  a  Court  in  3 [India],  of  an  offence  punishable  under  Chapter  XII  or  Chapter  XVII  of  this  Code with imprisonment of either description for a term of three years or upwards,  4 ***  5 *    *    *    *    *  shall  be  guilty  of  any  offence  punishable  under  either  of  those  Chapters  with  like  imprisonment  for  the  like  term,  shall  be  subject  for  every  such  subsequent offence  to  6 [imprisonment  for  life], or  to  imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years.]  CHAPTER IV  GENERAL EXCEPTIONS  76.  Act  done  by  a  person  bound,  or  by  mistake  of  fact  believing  himself  bound,  by  law.— Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by  reason of a mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be, bound by law to do it.  Illustrations  (a)  A,  a  soldier,  fires  on  a  mob  by  the  order  of  his  superior  officer,  in  conformity  with  the  commands  of  the  law.  A  has  committed no offence.  (b) A, an officer of a Court of Justice, being ordered by that Court to arrest Y, and after due enquiry, believing Z to be Y,  arrests Z. A has committed no offence.  77.  Act  of  Judge  when  acting  judicially.—Nothing  is  an  offence  which  is  done  by  a  Judge  when  acting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or which in good faith he believes to be, given to  him by law.  78. Act done pursuant to the judgment or order of Court.—Nothing which is done in pursuance  of, or which is warranted by the judgment or order of, a Court of Justice; if done whilst such judgment or  order remains in force, is an offence, notwithstanding the Court may have had no jurisdiction to pass such  judgment  or  order,  provided  the  person  doing  the  act  in  good  faith  believes  that  the  Court  had  such  jurisdiction.                                                              1. Subs. by Act 8 of 1862, s. 5, for “be less than a”.  2. Subs. by Act 3 of 1910, s. 2, for section 75.  3. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A. O. 1948, the A. O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch.,  to read as above.  4. The word “or” omitted by Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch.  5. Cl. (b) omitted by s. 3 and the Sch., ibid.  6. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956).   25    79.  Act  done  by  a  person  justified,  or  by  mistake of fact  believing  himself, justified,  by  law.— Nothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake  of  fact  and  not  by  reason  of  a  mistake  of  law  in  good  faith,  believes  himself  to  be justified  by  law,  in  doing it.  Illustration  A sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder. A, in the exercise, to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith, of  the power which the law gives to all persons of apprehending murderers in the fact, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper  authorities. A has committed no offence, though it may turn out that Z was acting in self-defence.  80. Accident in doing a lawful act.—Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune,  and without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful  means and with proper care and caution.  Illustration  A  is  at  work  with  a  hatchet;  the  head  flies  off  and  kills  a  man  who  is standing  by.  Here,  if  there  was  no  want  of  proper  caution on the part of A, his act is excusable and not an offence.  81.  Act  likely  to  cause  harm,  but  done  without  criminal  intent,  and  to  prevent  other  harm.— Nothing  is  an  offence  merely  by  reason  of  its  being  done  with  the  knowledge  that  it  is  likely  to  cause  harm,  if  it  be  done  without  any  criminal  intention  to  cause  harm,  and  in  good  faith  for  the  purpose  of  preventing or avoiding other harm to person or property.  Explanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was  of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that  it was likely to cause harm.  Illustrations  (a)  A,  the  captain  of  a  steam  vessel,  suddenly, and  without  any  fault  or  negligence  on  his  part,  finds  himself  in  such  a  position  that,  before  he  can  stop  his  vessel,  he  must  inevitably  run  down  a  boat  B,  with  twenty  or  thirty  passengers  on  board,  unless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with  only two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear.  Here, if  A alters his course  without any intention to run down the  boat  C  and  in  good  faith  for the purpose  of  avoiding  the danger  to  the  passengers  in the boat  B, he  is  not  guilty  of  an  offence,  though he may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of  fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C.  (b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention  in  good  faith  of  saving  human  life  or  property.  Here,  if  it  be  found that  the  harm  to  be  prevented  was  of  such  a  nature  and  so  imminent as to excuse A's act, A is not guilty of the offence.  82. Act of a child under seven years of age.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under  seven years of age.   83.  Act  of  a child  above  seven  and  under  twelve  of  immature  understanding.—Nothing  is  an  offence  which  is  done  by  a  child  above  seven  years  of  age  and  under  twelve,  who  has  not  attained  sufficient  maturity  of  understanding  to  judge  of  the  nature  and  consequences  of  his conduct  on  that  occasion.  84. Act of a person of unsound mind.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the  time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that  he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law.  85.  Act  of  a  person  incapable  of  judgment  by  reason  of intoxication  caused  against  his  will.— Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication,  incapable  of  knowing  the  nature  of  the  act,  or  that  he  is  doing  what  is  either  wrong,  or  contrary  to   law: provided  that  the  thing  which  intoxicated  him  was  administered  to  him  without  his knowledge  or  against his will.  86. Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated.— In cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person  who does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge  as  he  would have  had  if  he  had  not  been  intoxicated,  unless  the  thing  which  intoxicated  him  was  administered to him without his knowledge or against his will.   26    87.  Act  not  intended  and  not  known  to  be  likely  to  cause  death  or  grievous  hurt,  done  by  consent.—Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not known by the  doer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause,  or be intended by the doer to cause, to any person, above eighteen years of age, who has given consent,  whether express or implied, to suffer that harm; or by reason of any harm which it may be known by the  doer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of that harm.  Illustration  A  and Z  agree  to  fence  with  each  other  for  amusement.  This  agreement  implies  the  consent  of  each  to  suffer  any  harm  which,  in  the  course  of  such  fencing,  may  be  caused  without  foul  play;  and  if  A,  while  playing  fairly,  hurts  Z,  A  commits  no  offence.  88.  Act  not intended  to  cause  death,  done  by  consent  in  good  faith  for  person's  benefit.— Nothing, which is not intented to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or  be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose  benefit it is  done  in good faith, and  who has given  a  consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that  harm, or to take the risk of that harm.  Illustration  A, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death of Z, who suffers under the painful complaint,  but not intending to cause Z's death, and intending, in good faith, Z's benefit, performs that operation on Z, with Z's consent. A  has committed no offence.  89. Act done in good faith for benefit of child or insane person, by or by consent of guardian.— Nothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or of unsound  mind, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of  that person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause  or be known by the doer to be likely to cause to that person: Provided—  Provisos. First.—That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or to the  attempting to cause death;  Secondly.—That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing  it  knows  to  be  likely  to cause  death, for  any  purpose  other than the  preventing of  death  or  grievous  hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity;  Thirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the  attempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt, or  the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity;  Fourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing  of which offence it would not extend.  Illustration  A, in good faith, for his child's benefit without his child's consent, has his child cut for the stone by a surgeon knowing it to  be  likely  that  the  operation  will  cause  the  child's  death,  but  not  intending  to  cause  the  child's  death.  A  is  within  the  exception,   inasmuch as his object was the cure of the child.  90. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception.—A consent is not such a consent as  is intended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a  misconception  of  fact,  and  if  the  person  doing  the  act  knows,  or  has  reason  to  believe,  that  the  consent  was given in consequence of such fear or misconception; or  Consent of insane person.—if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or  intoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or  Consent of child.—unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person  who is under twelve years of age.  91. Exclusion  of  acts  which  are  offences  independently  of  harm  cause.—The  exceptions  in  sections  87,  88  and  89  do not  extend  to  acts  which  are  offences  independently  of  any  harm  which  they  may cause, or be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or  on whose behalf the consent is given.   27    Illustration  Causing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman) is offence independently  of any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. Therefore, it is not an offence “by reason of such harm”;  and the consent of the woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act.  92.  Act  done in  good  faith  for  benefit  of  a  person  without  consent.—Nothing  is  an  offence  by  reason of any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without  that person's consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent,  or if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of  him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit: Provided—  Provisos. First.—That  this  exception  shall  not  extend  to  the  intentional  causing  of  death, or the  attempting to cause death;  Secondly.—That  this  exception  shall  not  extend  to  the  doing  of  anything  which  the  person  doing  it  knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or  the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity;  Thirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to  cause hurt, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt;  Fourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing of  which offence it would not extend.  Illustrations  (a)  Z is  thrown  from  his  horse,  and is  insensible.  A,  a  surgeon,  finds  that  Z  requires  to be  trepanned.  A,  not  intending  Z's  death, but in good faith, for Z's benefit, performs the trepan before Z recovers his power of judging for himself. A has committed  no offence.  (b) Z is carried off by a tiger. A fires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may kill Z, but not intending to kill Z,  and in good faith intending Z's benefit. A's ball gives Z a mortal wound. A has committed no offence.  (c) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal unless an operation be immediately performed.  There  is  not  time  to  apply  to  the  child's  guardian.  A  performs  the  operation  in  spite of  the  entreaties  of  the  child,  intending,  in  good faith, the child's benefit. A has committed no offence.  (d) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People below hold out a blanket. A drops the child from the housestop,  knowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith, the child's  benefit. Here, even if the child is killed by the fall, A has committed no offence.  Explanation.—Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of sections 88, 89 and 92.  93. Communication made in good faith.—No communication made in good faith is an offence by  reason of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person.  Illustration  A, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he cannot live. The patient dies in consequence of the  shock. A has committed no offence, though he knew it to be likely that the communication might cause the patient's death.  94. Act to which a person is compelled by threats.—Except murder, and offences against the State  punishable  with  death,  nothing  is  an  offence  which  is  done  by  a  person  who  is  compelled  to  do  it  by  threats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person  will otherwise be the consequence: Provided the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or from a  reasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which  he became subject to such constraint.  Explanation 1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason  of a  threat of being beaten, joins  a  gang of dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the ground of  his having been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law.  Explanation 2.—A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instant death, to do a  thing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door of  a house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the benefit of this exception.   28    95. Act causing slight harm.—Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to  cause,  or  that  it  is  known  to  be  likely  to  cause,  any  harm,  if  that  harm  is  so  slight  that  no  person  of  ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm.  Of the Right of Private Defence  96. Things  done  in  private  defence.—Nothing  is  an  offence  which  is  done  in  the  exercise  of  the  right of private defence.  97. Right of private defence of the body and of property.—Every person has a right, subject to the  restrictions contained in section 99, to defend—  First.—His  own  body,  and  the  body  of  any  other  person,  against  any  offence  affecting  the  human  body;  Secondly.—The property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against  any act which is an offence falling under the defintion of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or  which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass.  98.  Right  of  private  defence  against  the  act  of a  person  of  unsound  mind,  etc.—When  an  act,  which  would  otherwise  be  a  certain  offence,  is  not  that  offence,  by  reason  of  the  youth,  the  want  of  maturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by  reason of any misconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence  against that act which he would have if the act were that offence.  Illustrations  (a)  Z,  under  the  influence  of  madness,  attempts  to  kill  A;  Z  is  guilty  of  no  offence.  But  A  has  the  same  right  of  private  defence which he would have if Z were sane.  (b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith, taking A for a house-breaker, attacks A.  Here  Z,  by  attacking  A  under  this  misconception,  commits  no  offence.  But  A  has  the  same  right  of  private  defence  against  Z,  which he would have if Z were not acting under that misconception.  99. Acts against which there is no right of private defence.—There is no right of private defence  against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or  attempted to be done, by a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though that act,  may not be strictly justifiable by law.  There is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension  of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant acting in  good faith under colour of his office, though that direction may not be strictly justifiable by law.  There is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to protection of  the public authorities.  Extent to which the right may be exercised.—The right of private defence in no case extends to the  inflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence.  Explanation  1.—A  person  is  not  deprived  of  the  right  of  private  defence  against  an  act  done,  or  attempted  to  be  done,  by  a  public  servant,  as  such,  unless  he  knows  or  has  reason  to  believe,  that  the  person doing the act is such public servant.  Explanation  2.—A  person  is  not  deprived  of  the  right  of  private  defence  against  an  act  done,  or  attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that  the person doing the act is acting by such direction, or unless such person states the authority under which  he acts, or if he has authority in writing, unless he produces such authority, if demanded.  100.  When  the  right  of  private  defence  of  the body  extends  to  causing  death.—The  right  of  private defence of the body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in the last preceding section, to the  voluntary  causing  of death  or  of  any  other  harm  to  the  assailant,  if  the  offence  which  occasions  the  exercise of the right be of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:—  First.—Such  an  assault  as  may  reasonably  cause  the  apprehension  that  death  will  otherwise be  the  consequence of such assault;   29    Secondly.—Such  an  assault  as  may  reasonably  cause  the  apprehension  that  grievous  hurt  will  otherwise be the consequence of such assault;  Thirdly.—An assault with the intention of committing rape;  Fourthly.—An assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural lust;  Fifthly.—An assault with the intention of kidnapping or abducting;  Sixthly.—An assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a person, under circumstances which  may reasonably cause him to apprehend that he will be unable to have recourse to the public authorities  for his release.  1 [Seventhly.—An  act  of  throwing  or  administering  acid  or  an  attempt  to  throw  or  administer  acid  which  may  reasonably  cause  the  apprehension  that  grievous  hurt  will  otherwise  be the  consequence  of  such act.]  101.  When  such  right  extends  to  causing  any  harm  other  than  death.—If  the  offence  be  not  of  any of the descriptions enumerated in the last preceding section, the right of private defence of the body  does not extend to the voluntary causing of death to the assailant, but does extend, under the restrictions  mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the assailant of any harm other than death.  102. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body.—The right of  private defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises  from an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed; and it  continues as long as such apprehension of danger to the body continues.  103.  When  the  right  of  private  defence  of  property  extends  to  causing  death.—The  right  of  private  defence  of  property  extends,  under  the  restrictions  mentioned  in  section  99,  to  the  voluntary  causing of death or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or the  attempting to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right, be an offence of any of the descriptions  hereinafter enumerated, namely:—  First.—Robbery;  Secondly.—House-breaking by night;  Thirdly.—Mischief by fire committed on any building, tent or vessel, which building, tent or vessel is  used as a human dwelling, or as a place for the custody of property;  Fourthly.—Theft,  mischief,  or  house-trespass,  under  such  circumstances  as  may  reasonably  cause  apprehension that death or grievous  hurt will be the  consequence, if such right of private  defence  is not  exercised.  104.  When  such  right extends to  causing  any  harm other  than  death.—If  the  offence,  the  committing  of  which,  or  the  attempting  to  commit  which  occasions  the  exercise  of  the  right  of  private  defence,  be  theft,  mischief,  or  criminal  trespass,  not  of  any  of  the  descriptions  enumerated  in  the  last  preceding section, that right does not extend to the voluntary causing of death, but does extend, subject to  the  restrictions  mentioned  in  section  99,  to  the  voluntary  causing  to  the  wrong-doer  of  any  harm  other  than death.  105. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of property.—The right of  private  defence  of  property  commences  when  a  reasonable  apprehension  of  danger  to  the  property  commences.  The right of private defence of property against theft continues till the offender has effected his retreat  with  the  property  or  either  the  assistance of  the  public  authorities  is  obtained,  or  the  property  has  been  recovered.  The right of private  defence  of property against robbery continues as  long as the offender causes or  attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or as long as the fear of instant death or  of instant hurt or of instant personal restraint continues.  The right of private defence of property against criminal trespass or mischief continues as long as the  offender continues in the commission of criminal trespass or mischief.                                                              1. Ins. by Act 13 of 2013, s. 2 (w.e.f. 3-2-2013).   30    The  right  of  private  defence  of  property  against  house-breaking  by  night  continues  as  long  as  the  house-trespass which has been begun by such house-breaking continues.  106.  Right  of  private  defence  against  deadly  assault  when  there  is  risk  of  harm  to  innocent  person.—If in the exercise of the right of private defence against an assault which reasonably causes the  apprehension  of  death,  the  defender  be  so  situated  that  he  cannot  effectually  exercise  that  right  without  risk of harm to an innocent person, his right of private defence extends to the running of that risk.  Illustration  A is attacked by a mob who attempt to murder him. He cannot effectually exercise his right of private defence without firing  on the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming young children who are mingled with the mob. A commits no offence if  by so firing he harms any of the children.  CHAPTER V  OF ABETMENT  107. Abetment of a thing.—A person abets the doing of a thing, who—  First.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or  Secondly.—Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that  thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of  that thing; or  Thirdly.—Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.  Explanation  1.—A  person who,  by  wilful  misrepresentation,  or  by  wilful  concealment  of  a  material  fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing  to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing.  Illustration  A, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z, B, knowing that fact and also that C is  not  Z,  wilfully  represents  to A  that  C  is  Z,  and  thereby  intentionally  causes  A  to  apprehend  C.  Here  B  abets  by  instigation  the  apprehension of C.  Explanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in  order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid  the doing of that act.  108.  Abettor.—A  person  abets  an  offence,  who  abets  either  the  commission  of  an  offence,  or  the  commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing  an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor.  Explanation  1.—The  abetment  of the  illegal  omission  of  an  act  may  amount  to  an  offence  although  the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act.  Explanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should  be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused.  Illustrations  (a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder.  (b)  A  instigates  B  to  murder  D.  B  in  pursuance  of  the  instigation  stabs  D.  D  recovers  from  the  wound.  A  is  guilty  of  instigating B to commit murder.  Explanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an  offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty  intention or knowledge.      31    Illustrations  (a)  A,  with  a  guilty  intention,  abets  a  child  or  a  lunatic  to  commit  an  act  which  would  be  an  offence,  if  committed  by  a  person capable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or  not, is guilty of abetting an offence.  (b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death.  B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here, though B was not capable  by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an  offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death.  (c)  A  instigates  B  to  set  fire  to  a  dwelling-house.  B,  in  consequence  of  the  unsoundness  of  his  mind,  being  incapable  of  knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's  instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to  the punishment provided for that offence.  (d)  A,  intending  to  cause  a  theft  to  be  committed,  instigates  B  to  take  property  belonging  to  Z  out  of  Z's possession.  A  induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's  property. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of  abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft.  Explanation  4.—The  abetment  of  an  offence  being  an  offence,  the  abetment of such an  abetment is  also an offence.  Illustration  A  instigates  B  to  instigate  C  to  murder  Z.  B  accordingly  instigates  C  to  murder  Z,  and  C  commits  that  offence  in  consequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B  to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment.  Explanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that  the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the  conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.  Illustration  A  concerts  with  B  a  plan  for  poisoning  Z.  It  is  agreed  that  A  shall  administer  the  poison.  B  then  explains  the  plan  to  C  mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison, and  procures  and  delivers  it  to  B  for  the  purpose  of  its  being  used  in  the  manner  explained.  A  administers  the  poison;  Z  dies  in  consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which  Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder.  1 [108A.  Abetment  in  India  of  offences  outside  India.—A  person  abets  an  offence  within  the  meaning  of  this  Code  who,  in  2 [India],  abets  the  commission of  any  act  without  and  beyond  2 [India]  which would constitute an offence if committed in  2 [India].  Illustration  A, in  2 [India], instigates B, a foreigner in Goa, to commit a murder in Goa, A is guilty of abetting murder.]  109.  Punishment of  abetment  if  the  act  abetted  is  committed  in  consequence  and  where  no  express  provision is made for  its  punishment.—Whoever abets  any offence shall, if the  act abetted  is  committed  in  consequence  of  the  abetment,  and  no  express  provision  is  made  by  this Code  for  the  punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.  Explanation.—An  act  or  offence  is  said  to  be  committed  in  consequence  of  abetment,  when  it  is  committed  in  consequence  of  the  instigation,  or  in  pursuance of  the  conspiracy,  or  with  the  aid  which  constitutes the abetment.  Illustrations  (a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in the exercise of B's official functions. B  accepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence defined in section 161.                                                              1. Added by Act 4 of 1898, s. 3.  2. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A.O. 1948, the A.O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch.,  to read as above.   32    (b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation, commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting  that offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B.  (c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to B in order that he  may  administer  it  to  Z.  B,  in  pursuance  of  the  conspiracy,  administers  the  poison  to  Z  in  A's  absence  and  thereby  causes  Z's  death. Here B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder.  110.  Punishment  of  abetment  if  person  abetted  does  act  with  different  intention  from  that  of  abettor.—Whoever  abets  the  commission  of  an  offence  shall,  if  the  person  abetted  does the  act  with  a  different intention or knowledge  from that of the  abettor, be  punished with the  punishment provided for  the offence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge  of the abettor and with no other.  111.  Liability  of  abettor  when  one  act abetted  and  different  act  done.—When  an  Act  is  abetted  and a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent  as if he had directly abetted it:  Provided  the  act  done  was  a  probable  consequence  of  the  abetment,  and  was  committed  under  the  influence  of  the  instigation,  or  with  the  aid  or  in  pursuance  of  the  conspiracy which  constituted  the  abetment.  Illustrations  (a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and  gives him poison for that purpose. The  child,  in  consequence  of  the  instigation,  by  mistake  puts  the  poison  into the  food  of  Y,  which  is  by  the  side of that of Z. Here, if the child was acting under the influence of A's instigation, and the act done was  under the circumstances a probable consequence of the  abetment, A is liable in the same  manner and to  the same extent as if he had instigated the child to put the poison into the food of Y.  (b) A instigates B to burn Z’s  house. B sets  fire to the  house  and at the  same  time  commits  theft of  property there. A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the theft; for  the theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence of the burning.  (c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and  provides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of  the inmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder was the probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable to  the punishment provided for murder.  112. Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done.—If the act  for which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is committed in addition to the act abetted,  and constitute a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences.  Illustration  A instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence, resists that distress. In offering the  resistance,  B  voluntarily  causes  grievous  hurt  to  the  officer  executing  the  distress.  As  B  has  committed  both  the  offence  of  resisting the distress, and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and,  if A knew that B was likely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress A will also be liable to punishment for each  of the offences.  113. Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different from that intended by  the abettor.—When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular  effect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, causes a different effect  from that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused, in the same manner and to the  same extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the  act abetted was likely to cause that effect.  Illustration  A  instigates  B  to  cause  grievous  hurt  to  Z.  B,  in  consequence  of  the  instigation,  causes  grievous  hurt  to  Z.  Z  dies  in  consequence.  Here,  if  A  knew  that  the  grievous  hurt  abetted  was  likely  to  cause  death,  A  is  liable  to  be  punished  with  the  punishment provided for murder.  114. Abettor present when offence is committed.—Whenever any person, who is absent would be  liable to be punished as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he would be punishable in  consequence of the abetment is committed, he shall be deemed to have committed such act or offence.   33    115.  Abetment  of  offence  punishable  with  death  or  imprisonment  for  life.—if  offence  not  committed.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence punishable with death or  1 [imprisonment for  life], shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is  made  by  this  Code  for  the  punishment  of  such  abetment,  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either  description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine;  if  act  causing  harm  be  done  in  consequence.—and  if  any  act  for  which  the  abettor  is  liable  in  consequence of the abetment, and which causes hurt to any person, is done, the abettor shall be liable to  imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and shall also be liable  to fine.  Illustration  A  instigates  B  to  murder  Z.  The  offence  is  not  committed.  If  B  had  murdered  Z,  he  would  have  been  subject to  the  punishment  of  death  or  1 [imprisonment  for life].  Therefore  A  is  liable  to  imprisonment  for  a  term  which  may  extend  to  seven  years and also to a fine; and if any hurt be done to Z in consequence of the abetment, he will be liable to imprisonment for a term  which may extend to fourteen years, and to fine.  116.  Abetment  of  offence  punishable  with  imprisonment—if  offence  be  not  committed.— Whoever  abets  an  offence  punishable  with  imprisonment  shall,  if  that  offence  be  not  committed  in  consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such  abetment, be  punished with imprisonment of any description provided  for that offence for a term which  may  extend  to  one-fourth  part  of  the  longest  term  provided  for  that  offence;  or  with  such  fine  as  is  provided for that offence, or with both;  if abettor or person abetted be a public servant whose duty it is to prevent offence.—and if the  abettor  or  the  person  abetted  is  a  public  servant,  whose  duty  it  is  to  prevent  the  commission  of  such  offence, the abettor shall be punished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence, for  a term which may extend to one-half of the longest term provided for that offence, or with such fine as is  provided for the offence, or with both.  Illustrations  (a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing. A some favour in the exercise of B's official functions. B  refuses to accept the bribe. A is punishable under this section.  (b) A instigates B to give false evidence. Here, if B does not give false evidence, A has nevertheless committed the offence  defined in this section, and is punishable accordingly.  (c) A, a police-officer, whose duty it is to prevent robbery, abets the commission of robbery. Here, though the robbery be not  committed, A is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for that offence, and also to fine.  (d)  B  abets  the  commission  of  a  robbery  by  A,  a  police-officer,  whose  duty  it  is  to  prevent  that  offence.  Here, though the  robbery be not committed, B is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for the offence of robbery,  and  also to fine.  117. Abetting commission of offence by the public or by more than ten persons.—Whoever abets  the commission of an offence by the public generally or by any number or class of persons exceeding ten,  shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or  with fine, or with both.  Illustration  A  affixes  in  a  public  place  a  placard  instigating  a  sect  consisting  of  more than  ten  members  to  meet  at  a  certain  time  and  place, for the purpose of attacking the members of an adverse sect, while engaged in a procession. A has committed the offence  defined in this section.  118.  Concealing  design  to  commit  offence  punishable  with death  or  imprisonment  for  life.— Whoever intending to facilitate or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby facilitate the commission of  an offence punishable with death or  1 [imprisonment for life],                                                                 1. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956).   34    1 [voluntarily conceals by  any  act  or  illegal omission, or  by  the  use  of  encryption  or  any  other  information  hiding  tool,  the  existence  of  a  design] to  commit  such  offence  or makes  any  representation  which he knows to be false respecting such design,  if  offence  be  committed;  if  offence  be  not committed.—shall,  if  that  offence  be  committed,  be  punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, or, if the  offence be not committed, with imprisonment of either description, for a term which may extend to three  years; and in either case shall also be liable to fine.  Illustration  A, knowing that dacoity is about to be committed at B, falsely informs the Magistrate that a dacoity is about to be committed  at C, a place in an opposite direction, and thereby misleads the Magistrate with intent to facilitate the commission of the offence.  The dacoity is committed at B in pursuance of the design. A is punishable under this section.  119.  Public  servant  concealing  design  to  commit  offence  which  it  is  his  duty  to  prevent.— Whoever,  being  a  public  servant  intending  to  facilitate  or  knowing  it  to  be  likely  that  he  will  thereby  facilitate the commission of an offence which it is his duty as such public servant to prevent,  1 [voluntarily  conceals,  by  any  act  or  illegal  omission  or  by  the  use  of  encryption  or  any  other  information hiding tool, the  existence of a  design] to commit such offence, or makes any representation  which he knows to be false respecting such design,  if offence be committed.—shall, if the offence be committed, be punished with imprisonment of any  description provided for the offence, for a term which may extend to one-half of the longest term of such  imprisonment, or with such fine as is provided for that offence, or with both;  if  offence  be  punishable  with  death,  etc.—or,  if  the  offence  be  punishable  with  death  or  2 [imprisonment  for  life],  with  imprisonment  of  either  description  for  a  term which  may  extend  to  ten  years;  if  offence  be  not  committed.—or,  if the  offence  be  not  committed,  shall  be  punished  with  imprisonment of any description provided for the offence for a term which may extend to one-fourth part  of the longest term of such imprisonment or with such fine as is provided for the offence, or with both.  Illustration  A,  an  officer  of  police,  being  legally  bound  to  give  information  of  all  designs  to  commit  robbery  which  may  come  to  his  knowledge,  and  knowing  that  B  designs  to  commit  robbery,  omits  to  give  such  information,  with  intent  to  facilitate  the  commission of that offence. Here A has by an illegal omission concealed the existence of B's design, and is liable to punishment  according to the provision of this section.  120.  Concealing  design  to  commit  offence punishable with  imprisonment.—Whoever, intending  to  facilitate  or  knowing  it  to  be  likely  that  he  will  thereby  facilitate  the  commission  of  an  offence  punishable with imprisonment,  voluntarily conceals, by any act or illegal omission, the existence of a design to commit such offence, or  makes any representation which he knows to be false respecting such design,  if  offence  be  committed; if  offence  be  not  committed.—shall,  if  the  offence  be  committed,  be  punished with imprisonment of the description provided for the offence, for a term which may extend to  one-fourth, and, if the offence be not committed, to one-eight, of the longest term of such imprisonment,  or with such fine as is provided for the offence, or with both.  3 [CHAPTER VA  CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY  120A.

CHAPTER XI  OF FALSE EVIDENCEAND OFFENCES AGAINST PUBLIC JUSTICE  191. Giving false evidence.—Whoever, being legally bound by an oath or by an express provision of  law to state the truth, or being bound by law to make a declaration upon any subject, makes any statement  which is false, and which he either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true, is said to  give false evidence.  Explanation1.—A  statement  is  within  the  meaning  of  this  section, whether  it is  made  verbally  or  otherwise.  Explanation 2.—A false statement as to the belief of the person attesting is within the meaning of this  section, and a person may be guilty of giving false evidence by stating that he believes a thing which he  does not believe, as well as by stating that he knows a thing which he does not know.  Illustrations  (a)  A,  in  support  of  a  just  claim  which  B  has  against  Z  for  one  thousand  rupees,  falsely  swears  on  a  trial  that  he  heard  Z  admit the justice of B's claim. A has given false evidence.  (b) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he believes a certain signature to be the handwriting of Z, when  he  does  not  believe  it  to  be  the  handwriting  of  Z.  Here  A  states  that  which  he  knows  to  be  false,  and  therefore gives  false  evidence.   50    (c) A, knowing the general character of Z's handwriting, states that he believes a certain signature to be the handwriting of  Z; A in good faith believing it to be so. Here A's statement is merely as to his belief, and is true as to his belief, and therefore,  although the signature may not be the handwriting of Z, A has not given false evidence.  (d) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he knows that Z was at a particular place on a particular day, not  knowing anything upon the subject. A gives false evidence whether Z was at that place on the day named or not.  (e) A, an interpreter or translator, gives or certifies as a true interpretation or translation of a statement or document which  he is bound by oath to interpret or translate truly, that which is not and which he does not believe to be a true interpretation or  translation. A has given false evidence.  192.  Fabricating  false  evidence.—Whoever  causes  any  circumstance  to  exist  or  1 [makes  any  false  entry in any book or record, or electronic record or makes any document or electronic record containing a  false statement,] intending that such circumstance, false entry or false statement may appear in evidence  in  a  judicial  proceeding,  or  in  a  proceeding  taken  by  law  before  a  public  servant  as  such,  or  before  an  arbitrator, and that such circumstance, false entry or false statement, so appearing in evidence, may cause  any  person  who  in  such  proceeding  is  to  form  an  opinion  upon  the  evidence,  to  entertain  an  erroneous  opinion touching any point material to the result of such proceeding is said “to fabricate false evidence”.  Illustrations  (a) A puts jewels into a box belonging to Z, with the intention that they may be found in that box, and that this circumstance  may cause Z to be convicted of theft. A has fabricated false evidence.  (b) A makes a false entry in his shop-book for the purpose of using it as corroborative evidence in a Court of Justice. A has  fabricated false evidence.  (c) A, with the intention of causing Z to be convicted of a criminal conspiracy, writes a letter in imitation of Z's handwriting,  purporting to be addressed to an accomplice in such criminal conspiracy, and puts the letter in a place which he knows that the  officers of the police are likely to search. A has fabricated false evidence.  193. Punishment  for  false  evidence.—Whoever  intentionally  gives  false  evidence  in  any  of  a  judicial  proceeding,  or fabricates  false  evidence for  the  purpose  of being  used in  any stage  of  a judicial  proceeding,  shall  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either  description  for  a  term  which  may  extend  to  seven years, and shall also be liable to fine;  and whoever intentionally gives or fabricates false evidence in any other case, shall be punished with  imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to  fine.  Explanation 1.—A trial before a Court-martial 2 ***is a judicial proceeding.  Explanation  2.—An  investigation  directed  by  law  preliminary  to  a  proceeding  before  a  Court  of  Justice, is a stage of a judicial proceeding, though that investigation may not take place before a Court of  Justice.  Illustration  A,  in  an  enquiry  before  a  Magistrate  for  the  purpose  of  ascertaining  whether  Z  ought to  be  committed  for  trial,  makes  on  oath a statement which he knows to be false. As this enquiry is a stage of a judicial proceeding, A as given false evidence.  Explanation  3.—An  investigation  directed  by  a  Court  of  Justice  according  to  law,  and  conducted  under the authority of a Court of Justice, is a stage of a judicial proceeding, though that investigation may  not take place before a Court of Justice.  Illustration  A, in an enquiry before  an officer deputed by a Court of Justice to ascertain on the spot the boundaries of land, makes on  oath a statement which he knows to be false. As this enquiry is a stage of a judicial proceeding, A has given false evidence.  194. Giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to procure conviction of capital offence.— Whoever gives or fabricates false evidence, intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he  will  thereby  cause,  any  person  to  be  convicted  of  an  offence  which  is  capital  3 [by  the  law for  the  time  being in force in  4 [India]] shall be punished with  5 [imprisonment for life], or with rigorous imprisonment  for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine;                                                              1.

Giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to procure conviction of offence punishable  with  imprisonment  for  life  or  imprisonment.—Whoever  gives  or  fabricates  false  evidence  intending  thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, any person to be convicted of an  offence  which  1 [by  the  law  for  the  time  being  in  force  in  2 [India]]  is  not capital,  but  punishable  with  3 [imprisonment  for  life],  or  imprisonment  for  a  term  of  seven  years  or  upwards,  shall  be  punished  as  a  person convicted of that offence would be liable to be punished.  Illustration  A gives false evidence before a Court of Justice, intending thereby to cause Z to be convicted of a dacoity. The punishment  of dacoity is  4 [imprisonment for life], or rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, with or without fine.  A, therefore, is liable to  5 [imprisonment for life] or imprisonment, with or without fine.  6 [195A. Threatening any  person  to  give  false  evidence.—Whoever  threatens  another  with  any  injury to his person, reputation or property or to the person or reputation of any one in whom that person  is interested, with intent to cause that person to give false evidence shall be punished with imprisonment  of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with both;  and if innocent person is convicted and sentenced in consequence of such false evidence, with death  or  imprisonment  for  more  than  seven  years,  the  person  who  threatens  shall  be  punished  with  the  same  punishment and sentence in the same manner and to the same extent such innocent person is punished and  sentenced.]  196.  Using  evidence  known  to  be  false.—Whoever  corruptly  uses  or  attempts  to  use  as  true  or  genuine  evidence  any evidence  which he  knows  to be  false or fabricated,  shall be  punished  in the  same  manner as if he gave or fabricated false evidence.  197. Issuing or signing false certificate.—Whoever issues or signs any certificate required by law to  be  given  or  signed,  or  relating  to  any  fact  of  which  such  certificate  is  by  law  admissible  in  evidence,  knowing  or  believing  that  such  certificate  is  false  in  any  material  point,  shall  be  punished  in  the  same  manner as if he gave false evidence.  198. Using as true a certificate known to be false.—Whoever corruptly uses or attempts to use any  such certificate as a true certificate, knowing the same to be false in any material point, shall be punished  in the same manner as if he gave false evidence.  199.

Using as true such declaration knowing it to be false.—Whoever corruptly uses or attempts to  use as true any such declaration, knowing the same to be false in any material point, shall be punished in  the same manner as if he gave false evidence.  Explanation.—A declaration which is inadmissible merely upon the ground of some informality, is a  declaration within the meaning of sections 199 and 200.  201.  Causing  disappearance  of  evidence  of  offence,  or  giving  false  information  to screen  offender.—Whoever,  knowing  or  having  reason  to  believe  that  an  offence  has  been  committed,  causes  any evidence of the commission of that offence to disappear, with the intention of screening the offender  from  legal  punishment,  or  with  that  intention  gives  any  information  respecting  the  offence  which  he  knows or believes to be false,                                                              1.

CHAPTER XVI  OF OFFENCESAFFECTINGTHE HUMAN BODY  Of offences affecting life  299.  Culpable  homicide.—Whoever  causes  death  by  doing  an act  with  the  intention  of  causing  death,  or  with  the  intention  of  causing  such  bodily  injury  as  is  likely  to  cause  death,  or  with  the  knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide.  Illustrations  (a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with the knowledge that death is likely to  be thereby caused. Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable  homicide.  (b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z's death,  induces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable  homicide.  (c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there.  Here, although A was doing an unlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B, or to cause  death by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause death.  Explanation 1.—A  person  who  causes  bodily  injury  to  another  who  is  labouring  under  a  disorder,  disease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused  his death.  Explanation 2.—Where  death  is  caused  by  bodily  injury,  the  person  who  causes  such  bodily  injury  shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment  the death might have been prevented.  Explanation 3.—The causing of the death of a child in the mother's womb is not homicide. But it may  amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought  forth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born.  300. Murder.—Except in the  cases  hereinafter excepted,  culpable  homicide is murder, if the  act by  which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or—  2ndly.—If  it  is  done  with  the  intention  of  causing  such  bodily  injury  as  the  offender  knows  to  be  likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or—  3rdly.—If  it  is  done  with  the  intention  of  causing  bodily  injury  to  any  person  and  the  bodily injury  intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or—  4thly.—If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all  probability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause  death, and commits  such act without  any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.  Illustrations  (a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder.  (b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention  of  causing  bodily  injury.  Z  dies  in  consequence  of  the  blow.  A  is  guilty  of  murder,  although  the  blow  might  not  have  been  sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is  labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of  health, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such  bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death.  (c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature.  Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death.  (d)  A  without  any  excuse  fires  a  loaded  cannon  into  a  crowd  of  persons  and  kills  one  of  them.  A  is  guilty  of  murder,  although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual.   70    Exception  1.—When  culpable  homicide  is  not  murder.—Culpable  homicide  is  not  murder  if  the  offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death  of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident.  The above exception is subject to the following provisos:—  First.—That  the  provocation  is  not sought  or voluntarily  provoked  by  the  offender as an  excuse for  killing or doing harm to any person.  Secondly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public  servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant.  Thirdly.—That  the  provocation  is  not  given  by  anything  done  in  the  lawful  exercise  of  the  right  of  private defence.  Explanation.—Whether  the  provocation  was  grave  and  sudden  enough  to  prevent  the  offence  from  amounting to murder is a question of fact.  Illustrations  (a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is  murder,  inasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in  doing an act caused by the provocation.  (b)  Y  gives  grave  and  sudden  provocation  to  A.  A,  on  this  provocation,  fires  a  pistol  at  Y,  neither  intending  nor  knowing  himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable  homicide.  (c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder,  inasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers.  (d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has  perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder.  (e)A attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so.  A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was giving by  a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence.  (f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and  to  cause  him  to  kill  Z,  puts  a  knife  into  B's  hand  for  that  purpose.  B  kills  Z  with  the  knife.  Here  B  may  have  committed  only  culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder.  Exception  2.—Culpable  homicide  is  not  murder  if  the  offender  in  the  exercise  in  good  faith  of  the  right  of  private  defence  of person  or  property,  exceeds  the  power  given  to  him  by  law  and  causes  the  death  of  the  person  against  whom  he  is  exercising  such  right  of  defence  without  premeditation,  and  without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence.  Illustration  Z  attempts  to  horsewhip  A,  not  in  such  a  manner  as  to  cause  grievous  hurt  to  A.  A  draws  out  a  pistol.  Z  persists  in  the  assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has  not committed murder, but only culpable homicide.  Exception  3.—Culpable  homicide  is  not  murder  if  the  offender,  being  a  public  servant  or  aiding  a  public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and  causes  death by  doing  an  act  which  he,  in  good  faith,  believes  to  be  lawful  and  necessary  for  the  due  discharge  of  his  duty  as  such  public  servant  and  without  ill-will  towards  the  person  whose  death  is  caused.  Exception 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden  fight  in  the  heat  of  passion  upon  a  sudden  quarrel  and  without  the  offender's  having  taken  undue  advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.  Explanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first  assault.  Exception 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above  the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent.      71    Illustration  A,  by instigation,  voluntarily  causes  Z,  a  person  under  eighteen  years  of  age to  commit  suicide.  Here,  on  account  of  Z's  youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder.  301.  Culpable  homicide  by  causing  death  of  person other  than  person  whose  death  was  intended.—If  a  person,  by  doing  anything  which  he  intends  or  knows  to  be  likely  to  cause  death,  commits culpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose death he neither intends nor knows  himself  to  be  likely  to  cause,  the  culpable  homicide  committed  by  the  offender  is  of  the  description  of  which  it  would  have  been  if  he  had  caused  the  death  of  the  person  whose  death  he  intended  or  knew  himself to he likely to cause.  302.   Punishment   for   murder.—Whoever   commits murder   shall   be   punished   with   death or  1 [imprisonment for life], and shall also be liable to fine.  303.  Punishment  for  murder  by  life-convict.—Whoever,  being  under  sentence  of  1 [imprisonment  for life], commits murder, shall be punished with death.  304.  Punishment for  culpable  homicide  not  amounting  to  murder.—Whoever  commits  culpable  homicide  not amounting to murder, shall be  punished with  1 [imprisonment for life], or imprisonment of  either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine, if the act by  which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as  is likely to cause death;  or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, or with fine, or  with both, if the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention  to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.  2 [304A. Causing death by negligence.—Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash  or  negligent  act  not  amounting  to  culpable  homicide, shall  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either  description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.]  3 [304B. Dowry death.—(1) Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or  occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that  soon  before  her  death  she was  subjected  to  cruelty  or  harassment  by  her  husband or  any  relative  of  her  husband for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called “dowry death”, and  such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death.  Explanation.—For  the  purposes  of  this  sub-section, “dowry” shall  have  the  same  meaning  as  in  section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (28 of 1961).  (2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be  less than seven years but which may extend to imprisonment for life.]  305.  Abetment  of  suicide  of  child  or  insane  person.—If  any  person  under  eighteen  years  of  age,  any  insane  person,  any  delirious  person,  any  idiot,  or  any  person  in  a  state  of  intoxication, commits  suicide,  whoever  abets  the  commission  of  such suicide, shall  be  punished  with  death  or  1 [imprisonment  for life], or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.  306.  Abetment  of suicide.—If  any  person  commits  suicide,  whoever  abets  the  commission  of  such  suicide,  shall  be punished  with  imprisonment  of  either  description  for  a  term  which  may  extend  to  ten  years, and shall also be liable to fine.  307. Attempt to murder.—Whoever does any act with such intention or knowledge, and under such  circumstances  that, if he by that act caused  death, he would be  guilty of murder, shall be  punished  with  imprisonment of either description for a  term which may extend  to ten  years,  and shall also  be  liable  to  fine; and if hurt is caused to any person by such act, the offender shall be liable either to  1 [imprisonment  for life], or to such punishment as is hereinbefore mentioned.                                                              1.

A is  liable to punishment under this section.  (b)  A,  with  the  intention  of  causing  the  death  of  a  child  of tender  years,  exposes  it  in  a  desert  place  A  has  committed  the  offence defined by this section, though the death of the child does not ensue.

Of Criminal Force and Assault  349.  Force.—A person  is  said  to  use  force  to  another  if  he  causes  motion,  change  of  motion,  or  cessation of motion to that other, or if he causes to any substance such  motion, or change  of motion, or  cessation  of  motion  as  brings  that  substance  into  contact  with  any  part  of  that  other's  body,  or  with  anything which that other is wearing or carrying, or with anything so situated that such contact affects that  other's sense of feeling: Provided that the person causing the motion, or change of motion, or cessation of  motion, causes that motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion in one of the three ways hereinafter  described:   78    First.—By his own bodily power.  Secondly.—By  disposing  any  substance  in  such  a  manner  that the  motion  or  change  or  cessation  of  motion takes place without any further act on his part, or on the part of any other person.  Thirdly.—By inducing any animal to move, to change its motion, or to cease to move.  350. Criminal force.—Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that person's consent,  in order to the committing of any offence, or intending by the use of such force to cause, or knowing it to  be likely that by the use of such force he will cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person to whom the  force is used, is said to use criminal force to that other.  Illustrations  (a) Z is sitting in a moored boat on a river. A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally causes the boat to drift down the  stream.  Here  A  intentionally  causes  motion to Z,  and he  does  this  by  disposing  substances  in  such  a  manner  that  the  motion  is  produced  without  any  other  action  on  any  person's  part.  A  has  therefore  intentionally  used  force  to  Z;  and  if  he  has  done  so  without Z's consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will  cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z.  (b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z's horses, and thereby causes them to quicken their pace. Here A has caused change of  motion to Z by inducing the animals to change their motion. A has therefore used force to Z; and if A has done this without Z's  consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z.  (c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the palanquin. Here A has caused cessation of  motion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally,  without Z's consent, in order to the commission of an offence. A has used criminal force to Z.  (d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved his own person so as to bring  it  into  contact  with  Z.  He  has  therefore  intentionally  used  force  to  Z;  and  if  he  has  done  so  without  Z's  consent,  intending  or  knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z.  (e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into contact with Z, or with Z's  clothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water and dash up the water against Z's clothes or something carried  by Z. Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z's clothes, A  has used force to Z, and if he did so without Z's consent, intending thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal  force to Z.  (f)  A  intentionally  pulls  up  a  Woman's  veil.  Here  A  intentionally  uses  force  to  her,  and  if  he  does  so  without  her  consent  intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her.  (g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A intentionally by his own bodily power  causes such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact  must  affect  Z's  sense  of  feeling; A  has  therefore  intentionally  used  force  to  Z;  and  if  he  has  done  this  without  Z's  consent  intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force.  (h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z's consent. Here, if A intends to cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses  criminal force to Z.  351. Assault.—Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely  that  such  gesture  or  preparation  will  cause  any  person  present  to  apprehend  that  he  who  makes  that  gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault.  Explanation.—Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give  to his  gestures  or preparation such a  meaning as may  make  those gestures  or preparations  amount to an  assault.  Illustrations  (a) A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that A is about to strike  Z. A has committed an assault.  (b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to  believe that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z. A has committed an assault upon Z.  (c) A takes up a stick, saying to Z, “I will give you a beating”. Here, though the words used by A could in no case amount to  an assault, and though the mere gesture, unaccompanied by any other circumstances, might not amount to an assault,the gesture  explained by the words may amount to an assault.  352. Punishment for  assault or  criminal force  otherwise than on grave  provocation.—Whoever  assaults  or  uses  criminal  force  to  any  person  otherwise  than  on  grave  and  sudden  provocation  given  by  that  person,  shall  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either  description  for  a  term  which  may  extend  to  three months, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both.   79    Explanation.—Grave  and sudden  provocation will not mitigate the punishment for an offence under  this  section,  if  the  provocation  is  sought  or  voluntarily  provoked  by  the  offender  as  an  excuse  for  the  offence, or  if  the  provocation  is  given  by  anything  done  in  obedience  to  the  law,  or  by  a  public  servant,  in  the  lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant, or  if the provocation is given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.   Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to mitigate the offence, is a question of fact.  353.

Theft.—Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of  any person without that person's  consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is  said to commit  theft.  Explanation 1.—A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the  subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth.  Explanation 2.—A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft.  Explanation 3.—A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented  it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it.  Explanation 4.—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal,  and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal.  Explanation  5.—The  consent  mentioned  in  the  definition  may  be  express  or  implied,  and  may  be  given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express  or implied.  Illustrations  (a)  A  cuts  down  a  tree  on  Z's  ground,  with  the  intention  of  dishonestly  taking  the  tree  out  of  Z's  possession  without  Z's  consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft.  (b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here, if A's intention be dishonestly to take the  dog out of Z's possession without Z's consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A.  (c)  A  meets  a  bullock  carrying  a  box  of  treasure.  He  drives  the  bullock  in  a  certain  direction,  in  order  that  he  may  dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure.  (d)  A  being  Z's  servant,  and  entrusted  by  Z  with  the  care  of  Z's  plate,  dishonestly  runs  away  with  the  plate,  without  Z's  consent. A has committed theft.  (e)  Z,  going  on  a  journey,  entrusts  his  plate  to  A,  the  keeper  of  a  warehouse,  till  Z  shall  return.  A  carries  the  plate  to  a  goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has  not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust.  (f)  A  finds  a  ring  belonging  to  Z  on  a  table  in  the  house  which  Z  occupies.  Here  the  ring  is  in  Z's  possession,  and  if  A  dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.  (g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he  may commit criminal misappropriation of property.  (h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear  of  search  and  detection,  A  hides  the  ring  in  a  place  where  it  is  highly  improbable  that  it  will  ever  be  found  by  Z,  with  the                                                              1. Subs. by Act 22 of 2018, s. 7, for “section 376D” (w.e.f. 21-4-2018).   2. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956).   89    intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the  ring, commits theft.  (i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for  which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand,  and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as  what he did was not done dishonestly.   (j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes  the  watch  out  of  Z's  possession,  with  the  intention  of  depriving  Z  of  the  property  as  a  security  for  his  debt,  he  commits  theft,  inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.  (k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's possession without Z's consent, not having paid what he  borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.  (l)  A  takes  an  article  belonging  to  Z  out  of  Z's  possession  without  Z's  consent,  with  the  intention  of  keeping  it  until  he  obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft.  (m)  A,  being  on  friendly  terms  with  Z,  goes  into  Z's  library  in  Z's  absence,  and  takes  away  a  book  without  Z's  express  consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived  that he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft.  (n) A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it  is probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A's impression, A has not committed  theft.  (o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such  property as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.  (p)  A,  in  good  faith,  believing  property  belonging  to  Z  to  be  A's  own  property,  takes  that  property  out  of  B's  possession.  Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft.  379. Punishment for theft.—Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either  description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.  380. Theft  in  dwelling  house,  etc.—Whoever  commits  theft  in  any  building,  tent  or  vessel,  which  building, tent or vessel is used as a human dwelling, or used for the custody of property, shall be punished  with  imprisonment  of  either  description  for  a  term  which  may  extend  to  seven  years,  and  shall  also  be  liable to fine.  381.  Theft  by  clerk  or  servant  of  property  in  possession  of  master.—Whoever,  being  a  clerk  or  servant, or being employed in the capacity of a clerk or servant, commits theft in respect of any property  in the possession of his master or employer, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for  a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.   382.  Theft  after  preparation  made  for  causing  death,  hurt  or  restraint  in  order  to the  committing of the theft.—Whoever commits  theft, having  made preparation for causing death, or hurt,  or restraint, or fear of death, or of hurt, or of restraint, to any person, in order to the committing of such  theft,  or  in  order  to  the  effecting  of  his  escape  after  the  committing  of  such  theft, or  in  order  to  the  retaining of property taken by such theft, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which  may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.    Illustrations  (a) A commits theft on property in Z's possession; and while committing this theft, he has a loaded pistol under his garment,  having  provided  this  pistol  for  the  purpose  of  hurting  Z  in  case  Z  should  resist.  A  has  committed  the offence  defined  in  this  section.  (b)  A  picks  Z's  pocket,  having  posted  several  of  his  companions  near  him,  in  order  that  they  may  restrain  Z,  if  Z  should  perceive what is passing and should resist, or should attempt to apprehend A. A has committed the offence defined in this section.  Of Extortion  383. Extortion.—Whoever intentionally puts any person in fear of any injury to that person, or to any  other, and thereby dishonestly induces the person so put in fear to deliver to any person any property, or  valuable security or anything signed or sealed which may be converted into a valuable security, commits  “extortion”.  Illustrations  (a) A threatens to publish a defamatory libel concerning Z unless Z gives him money. He thus induces Z to give him money.  A has committed extortion.   90    (b) A threatens Z that he will keep Z's child in wrongful confinement, unless Z will sign and deliver to A a promissory note  binding Z to pay certain monies to A. Z sings and delivers the note. A has committed extortion.  (c) A threatens to send club-men to plough up Z's field unless Z will sign and deliver to B a bond binding Z under a penalty  to deliver certain produce to B, and thereby induces Z to sign and deliver the bond. A has committed extortion.  (d) A, by putting Z in fear of grievous hurt, dishonestly induces Z to sign or affix his seal to a blank paper and deliver it to  A. Z sings and delivers the paper to A. Here, as the paper so signed may be converted into a valuable security. A has committed  extortion.  384. Punishment for extortion.—Whoever commits extortion shall be punished with imprisonment  of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.  385.  Putting  person  in  fear  of  injury in  order  to  commit  extortion.—Whoever,  in  order  to the  committing of extortion, puts any person in fear, or attempts to put any person in fear, of any injury, shall  be  punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which  may extend  to two years,  or with  fine, or with both.  386.  Extortion  by  putting  a  person  in  fear  of  death  or  grievous  hurt.—Whoever  commits  extortion by putting any person in fear of death or of grievous hurt to that person or to any other, shall be  punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also  be liable to fine.  387.  Putting  person  in  fear  of  death  or  of  grievous  hurt, in  order  to  commit  extortion.— Whoever, in order to the committing of extortion, puts or attempts to put any person in fear of death or of  grievous hurt to that person or to any other, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for  a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.  388. Extortion by threat of accusation of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for  life, etc.—Whoever commits extortion by putting any person in fear of an accusation against that person  or  any  other,  of  having  committed  or  attempted  to  commit  any  offence  punishable  with  death,  or  with  1 [imprisonment  for  life],  or  with  imprisonment for  a  term  which  may  extend  to  ten  years,  or  of  having  attempted  to  induce  any  other  person  to  commit  such  offence,  shall be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either  description  for  a  term  which  may  extend  to  ten  years,  and  shall  also  be  liable  to  fine;  and, if  the  offence be one punishable under section 377 of this Code, may be punished with  1 [imprisonment for life].  389. Putting person in fear or accusation of offence, in order to commit extortion.—Whoever, in  order to the committing of extortion, puts or attempts to put any person in fear of an accusation, against  that person or any other, of having committed, or attempted to commit, an offence punishable with death  or with  1 [imprisonment for life], or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, shall be  punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also  be liable to fine; and, if the offence be punishable under section 377 of this Code, may be punished with  1 [imprisonment for life].  Of Robbery and Dacoity  390. Robbery.—In all robbery there is either theft or extortion.  When  theft  is  robbery.—Theft  is “robbery” if,  in  order  to  the  committing  of  the  theft,  or  in  committing the theft, or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by the theft, the  offender,  for  that end voluntarily  causes  or  attempts  to  cause  to  any  person  death  or  hurt  or  wrongful  restraint, or fear of instant death or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint.  When  extortion  is  robbery.—Extortion is “robbery” if  the  offender,  at  the  time  of  committing  the  extortion, is in the presence of the person put in fear, and commits the extortion by putting that person in  fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint to that person or to some other person,  and, by so putting in fear, induces the person so put in fear then and there to deliver up the thing extorted.  Explanation.—The  offender  is  said  to  be  present  if  he  is  sufficiently  near to put the  other person  in  fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint.                                                                 1. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956).   91    Illustrations  (a)  A  holds  Z  down,  and  fraudulently  takes  Z's  money  and  jewels  from  Z's  clothes,  without  Z's  consent.  Here  A  has  committed  theft,  and,  in  order  to  the  committing  of  that  theft,  has voluntarily  caused  wrongful  restraint  to  Z.  A  has  therefore  committed robbery.  (b) A meets Z on the high road, shows a pistol, and demands Z's purse. Z, in consequence, surrenders his purse. Here A has  extorted the purse from Z by putting him in fear of instant hurt, and being at the time of committing the extortion in his presence.  A has therefore committed robbery.  (c) A meets Z and Z's child on the high road. A takes the child, and threatens to filing it down a precipice, unless Z delivers  his purse. Z, in consequence, delivers his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z, by causing Z to be in fear of instant hurt to  the child who is there present. A has therefore committed robbery on Z.  (d) A obtains property from Z by saying “Your child is in the hands of my gang, and will be put to death unless you send us  ten thousand rupees”. This is extortion, and punishable as such: but it is not robbery, unless Z is put in fear of the instant death of  his child.  391.  Dacoity.—When  five  or  more  persons  conjointly  commit  or  attempt  to  commit  a  robbery,  or  where  the  whole  number  of  persons  conjointly  committing  or  attempting  to  commit  a  robbery,  and  persons  present  and  aiding  such  commission  or  attempt,  amount  to  five  or  more,  every  person  so  committing, attempting or aiding, is said to commit “dacoity”.  392.  Punishment  for  robbery.—Whoever  commits   robbery   shall   be  punished   with  rigorous  imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine; and, if the robbery  be committed on the highway between sunset and sunrise, the imprisonment may be extended to fourteen  years.  393.  Attempt  to  commit  robbery.—Whoever  attempts  to  commit  robbery  shall  be  punished  with  rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.  394.  Voluntarily  causing  hurt  in  committing  robbery.—If  any  person,  in  committing  or  in  attempting  to  commit  robbery,  voluntarily  causes  hurt,  such  person,  and  any  other  person  jointly  concerned  in  committing  or  attempting  to  commit such  robbery,  shall  be  punished  with  1 [imprisonment  for life], or with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable  to fine.  395. Punishment for dacoity.—Whoever commits dacoity shall be punished with  1 [imprisonment for  life], or with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to  fine.  396.

Illustrations  (a)  A  takes  property  belonging  to  Z  out  of  Z's  possession, in  good  faith believing at  the  time  when  he  takes  it,  that  the  property belongs to himself. A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property  to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section.  (b)  A,  being  on  friendly  terms  with  Z,  goes  into  Z's  library  in  Z's absence, and  takes  away  a  book  without  Z's  express  consent. Here, if A was under the impression that he had Z's implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has  not committed theft. But, if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section.  (c) A and B, being, joint owners of a horse, A takes the horse out of B's possession, intending to use it. Here, as A has a right  to use the horse, he does not dishonestly  misappropriate it. But, if  A sells the horse and appropriates the whole proceeds to his  own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section.  Explanation 1.—A dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation with the meaning  of this section.  Illustration  A finds a Government promissory note belonging to Z, bearing a blank endorsement. A, knowing that the note belongs to Z,  pledges it with a banker as a security or a loan, intending at a future time to restore it to Z. A has committed an offence under this  section.  Explanation  2.—A  person  who  finds  property  not  in  the  possession  of  any  other  person,  and takes  such  property  for  the  purpose  of  protecting  it  for,  or  of  restoring  it  to,  the  owner,  does  not  take  or  misappropriate it dishonestly, and is not guilty of an offence; but he is guilty of the offence above defined,  if he appropriates it to his own use, when he knows or has the means of discovering the owner, or before  he  has  used  reasonable  means  to  discover  and  give  notice  to  the  owner  and  has  kept  the  property  a  reasonable time to enable the owner to claim it.  What are reasonable means or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is a question of fact.  It is not necessary that the finder should know who is the owner of the property, or that any particular  person is the owner of it; it is sufficient if, at the time of appropriating it, he does not believe it to be his  own property, or in good faith believe that the real owner cannot be found.  Illustrations  (a)  A  finds  a  rupee  on  the  high road,  not  knowing  to  whom the  rupee  belongs,  A  picks  up  the  rupee.  Here  A  has  not  committed the offence defined in this section.  (b) A finds a letter on the road, containing a bank note. From the direction and contents of the letter he learns to whom the  note belongs. He appropriates the note. He is guilty of an offence under this section.                                                              1. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956).   93    (c) A finds a cheque payable to bearer. He can form no conjecture as to the person who has lost the cheque. But the name of  the person, who has drawn the cheque, appears. A knows that this person can direct him to the person in whose favour the cheque  was drawn. A appropriates the cheque without attempting to discover the owner. He is guilty of an offence under this section.  (d)  A  sees  Z  drop  his  purse  with  money  in  it.  A  picks up  the  purse  with  the  intention  of  restoring  it  to  Z,  but afterwards  appropriates it to his own use. A has committed an offence under this section.  (e)  A  finds  a  purse  with  money,  not  knowing  to  whom  it  belongs;  he  afterwards  discovers  that  it  belongs  to  Z,  and  appropriates it to his own use. A is guilty of an offence under this section.  (f)  A  finds  a  valuable  ring,  not  knowing  to  whom  it  belongs.  A  sells  it  immediately  without  attempting  to  discover  the  owner. A is guilty of an offence under this section.  404.  Dishonest  misappropriation  of  property  possessed  by  deceased  person  at  the  time  of  his  death.—Whoever  dishonestly  misappropriates  or  converts  to  his  own  use  property,  knowing  that  such  property was in the possession of a deceased person at the time of that person's decease, and has not since  been  in  the  possession  of  any  person  legally  entitled  to  such  possession,  shall  be  punished  with  imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to  fine, and if the offender at the time of such person's decease was employed by him as a clerk or servant,  the imprisonment may extend to seven years.  Illustration  Z  dies  in  possession  of  furniture  and  money.  His  servant  A,  before  the  money  comes  into  the  possession  of  any  person  entitled to such possession, dishonestly misappropriates it. A has committed the offence defined in this section.  Of Criminal Breach of Trust  405. Criminal breach of trust.—Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any  dominion  over  property,  dishonestly  misappropriates  or  converts  to  his  own  use  that  property,  or  dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in  which  such  trust  is  to  be  discharged,  or  of  any  legal  contract,  express  or  implied,  which  he  has  made  touching  the  discharge  of  such  trust,  or  wilfully  suffers  any  other  person  so  to  do,  commits “criminal  breach of trust”.  1 [ 2 [Explanation  1].—A  person,  being  an  employer  3 [of  an  establishment  whether  exempted  under  section  17  of the  Employees’ Provident  Funds  and  Miscellaneous  Provisions  Act,  1952 (19  of  1952)  or  not] who deducts the employee’s contribution  from  the  wages  payable  to  the  employee  for  credit  to  a  Provident  Fund  or  Family  Pension  Fund  established  by  any  law  for  the  time  being  in  force,  shall  be  deemed to have been entrusted with the amount of the contribution so deducted by him and if he makes  default in the payment of such contribution to the said Fund in violation of the said law, shall be deemed  to  have  dishonestly  used  the  amount  of  the  said  contribution  in  violation  of  a direction  of  law  as  aforesaid.]  4 [Explanation  2.—A  person,  being  an  employer,  who  deducts  the  employees’ contribution  from  the  wages payable to the employee for credit to the Employees’ State Insurance Fund held and administered  by  the  Employees’ State  Insurance  Corporation  established  under  the  Employees’ State Insurance  Act,  1948  (34  of  1948),  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  entrusted  with  the  amount  of  the  contribution  so  deducted by him and if he makes default in the payment of such contribution to the said Fund in violation  of the said Act, shall be deemed to have dishonestly used the amount of the said contribution in violation  of a direction of law as aforesaid.]  Illustrations  (a) A, being executor to the will of a deceased person, dishonestly disobeys the law which directs him to divide the effects  according to the will, and appropriates them to his own use. A has committed criminal breach of trust.  (b) A is a warehouse-keeper. Z going on a journey, entrusts his furniture to A, under a contract that it shall be returned on  payment of a stipulated sum for warehouse room. A dishonestly sells the goods. A has committed criminal breach of trust.                                                               1. Ins. by Act 40 of 1973, s. 9 (w.e.f. 1-11-1973).  2.

There is an express or implied contract between A and Z, that all  sums remitted by Z to A shall be invested by A, according to Z's direction. Z remits a lakh of rupees to A, with directions to A to  invest  the  same  in  Company's  paper.  A  dishonestly  disobeys  the directions  and  employs  the  money  in  his  own business.  A  has  committed criminal breach of trust.  (d) But if A, in the last illustration, not dishonestly but in good faith, believing that it will be more for Z's advantage to hold  shares in the Bank of Bengal, disobeys Z's directions, and buys shares in the Bank of Bengal, for Z, instead of buying Company's  paper, here, thought Z should suffer loss, and should be entitled to bring a civil action against A, on account of that loss, yet A,  not having acted dishonestly, has not committed criminal breach of trust.  (e)  A,  a  revenue-officer,  is  entrusted  with  public money  and  is  either  directed  by  law,  or  bound  by  a  contract,  express  or  implied, with the Government, to pay into a certain treasury all the public money which he holds.

Explanation.—A dishonest concealment of facts is a deception within the meaning of this section.  Illustrations  (a)  A,  by  falsely  pretending  to be  in  the  Civil  Service,  intentionally  deceives  Z,  and  thus  dishonestly  induces  Z  to let  him  have on credit goods for which he does not mean to pay.

A cheats.  (d) A, by tendering in payment for an article a bill on a house with which A keeps no money, and by which A expects that  the  bill  will  be  dishonoured,  intentionally  deceives  Z,  and  thereby  dishonestly  induces  Z  to  deliver  the  article,  intending  not  to  pay for it.

(g) A intentionally deceives Z into a belief that A means to deliver to Z a certain quantity of indigo plant which he does not  intend to deliver, and thereby dishonestly induces Z to advance money upon the faith of such delivery. A cheats; but if A, at the  time  of  obtaining  the  money,  intends  to  deliver  the  indigo  plant,  and  afterwards  breaks  his  contract  and  does  not  deliver  it, he  does not cheat, but is liable only to a civil action for breach of contract.  (h)  A  intentionally  deceives  Z  into  a  belief  that  A  has  performed  A's  part  of  a  contract  made  with  Z,  which  he  has  not  performed, and thereby dishonestly induces Z to pay money. A cheats.  (i) A sells and conveys an estate to B. A, knowing that in consequence of such sale he has no right to the property, sells or  mortgages  the  same  to  Z,  without  disclosing  the  fact  of  the  previous  sale  and  conveyance  to  B,  and  receives  the  purchase  or  mortgage money from Z.

Explanation 1.—It is not essential to the offence of mischief that the offender should intend to cause  loss or damage to the owner of the property injured or destroyed. It is sufficient if he intends to cause, or  knows that he is likely to cause, wrongful loss or damage to any person by injuring any property, whether  it belongs to that person or not.

Making  a  false  document.— 3 [A  person  is  said  to  make  a  false  document  or false electronic  record—  First.—Who dishonestly or fraudulently—  (a) makes, signs, seals or executes a document or part of a document;  (b) makes or transmits any electronic record or part of any electronic record;  (c) affixes any  4 [electronic signature] on any electronic record;  (d)  makes  any  mark  denoting  the  execution  of  a  document  or  the  authenticity  of  the  4 [electronic signature],  with  the  intention  of  causing  it  to  be  believed  that  such  document  or part of document,  electronic  record or  4 [electronic signature] was made, signed,  sealed, executed, transmitted or affixed  by or by the  authority  of  a  person  by  whom  or  by  whose  authority he  knows  that  it  was  not  made,  singed,  sealed,  executed or affixed; or  Secondly.—Who  without lawful authority, dishonestly or fraudulently, by cancellation or otherwise,  alters a document or an electronic record in any material part thereof, after it has been made, executed or  affixed  with  4 [electronic  signature]  either  by  himself  or  by  any  other  person,  whether  such  person  be  living or dead at the time of such alteration; or  Thirdly.—Who  dishonestly  or  fraudulently  causes  any  person  to  sign,  seal,  execute  or  alter  a  document or an electronic record or to affix his  4 [electronic signature] on any electronic record knowing  that such person by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication cannot, or that by reason of deception                                                              1. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956).  2. The words “TRADE OR” omitted by Act 43 of 1958, s. 135 and Sch. (w.e.f. 25-11-1959).  3. Subs. by Act 21 of 2000, s. 91 and the First Sch., for certain words (w.e.f. 17-10-2000).  4. Subs. by Act 10 of 2009, s. 51, for “digital signature” (w.e.f. 27-10-2009).   102    practised upon him, he does not know the contents of the document or electronic record or the nature of  the alteration.]  Illustrations  (a) A has a letter of credit upon B for rupees 10,000, written by Z. A, in order to defraud B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and  makes the sum 1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.   (b) A, without Z's authority, affixes Z's seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the  intention of selling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery.  (c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque.  A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery.  (d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable and authorizes B to fill  up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently  fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery.  (e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B's authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill  with  a  banker  and  intending  to  take  up  the  bill  on  its  maturity. Here,  as  A  draws  the  bill  with  intent  to  deceive  the  banker  by  leading him to suppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery.  (f)  Z's  will  contains  these  words—“I  direct  that  all  my  remaining  property  be  equally  divided  between  A,  B  and  C.” A  dishonestly scratches out B's name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed  forgery.  (g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on the bill the words “Pay  to Z or his order” and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words “Pay to Z or his order”, and thereby converts the  special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery.  (h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same  estate to B, dated six  months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the  estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery.  (i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has  prepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery.  (j)  A  writes  a  letter  and  signs  it  with  B's  name  without  B's  authority,  certifying  that  A  is  a  man  of  good  character  and  in  distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons.  Here, as A made a false document in order to induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery.  (k)  A  without  B's  authority  writes  a  letter  and  signs  it  in  B's  name  certifying  to  A's  character,  intending  thereby  to  obtain  employment  under  Z. A  has  committed  forgery  inasmuch  as  he  intended  to  deceive  Z  by  the  forged  certificate,  and  thereby  to  induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract for service.  Explanation 1.—A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery.  Illustrations  (a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person  of the same name. A has committed forgery.  (b) A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z's name, in order that B may afterwards write on the  paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery;  and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A's intention, B is also guilty of forgery.  (c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own  name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed  forgery.  (d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z,  executes a lease of the estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with  intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in  his own name, commits forgery by antedating it.  (e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A's benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors;  and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum  for value received,  and  antedates  the  note,  intending  that  it  may  be  believed  to  have  been  made  before  A  was  on  the  point  of  insolvency.  A  has  committed forgery under the first head of the definition.  Explanation 2.—The making of a false document in the name of a fictious person, intending it to be  believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to  be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery.      103    Illustration  A  draws  a  bill  of  exchange  upon  a  fictious  person,  and  fraudulently  accepts  the  bill  in  the  name  of  such  fictitious  person  with  intent to negotiate it. A commits forgery.  1 [Explanation 3.—For  the  purposes  of  this  section,  the  expression “affixing  2 [electronic  signature]”  shall  have  the  meaning  assigned  to  it  in  clause  (d)  of  sub-section  (1)  of  section  2  of  the  Information  Technology Act, 2000 (21 of 2000).]  465.
